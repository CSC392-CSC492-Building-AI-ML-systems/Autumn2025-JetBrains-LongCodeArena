Cumulative Incidence Module
===========================

This module provides tools for estimation and inference of survival and cumulative incidence functions in the presence of right censoring. It supports calculation of survival probabilities, cumulative incidence functions for competing risks, and their associated standard errors. Frequency weights and entry times (delayed entry) are also supported.

Functions
---------

_calc_survfunc_right(time, status, weights=None, entry=None, compress=True, retall=True)
    Calculate the survival function and its standard error for a single group.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : array_like
        Event or censoring times.
    status : array_like
        Event indicator (1 if event occurred, 0 if censored).
    weights : array_like, optional
        Frequency weights for observations.
    entry : array_like, optional
        Entry times for delayed entry (left truncation).
    compress : bool, optional
        If True, only retain times where an event occurred.
    retall : bool, optional
        If True, return additional intermediate results.

    Returns
    -------
    sp : ndarray
        Estimated survival probabilities.
    se : ndarray
        Standard errors of the survival probabilities.
    utime : ndarray
        Unique event times.
    rtime : ndarray
        Ranks of times.
    n : ndarray
        Risk set sizes at each event time.
    d : ndarray
        Number of events at each event time.

_calc_incidence_right(time, status, weights=None)
    Calculate the cumulative incidence function and its standard error for competing risks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : array_like
        Event or censoring times.
    status : array_like
        Event type indicators (0 for censored, 1, 2, ... for different causes).
    weights : array_like, optional
        Frequency weights for observations.

    Returns
    -------
    ip : list of ndarray
        Cumulative incidence function estimates for each cause.
    se : list of ndarray or None
        Standard errors for each cumulative incidence function. None if weights are provided.
    utime : ndarray
        Unique event times.

_checkargs(time, status, entry, freq_weights, exog)
    Validate input arguments for consistency and correctness.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : array_like
        Event or censoring times.
    status : array_like
        Event indicators.
    entry : array_like or None
        Entry times for delayed entry.
    freq_weights : array_like or None
        Frequency weights.
    exog : array_like or None
        Covariate matrix.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If input arrays have inconsistent lengths or invalid values.

Classes
-------

class CumIncidenceRight
    Estimation and inference for a cumulative incidence function with right censoring.

    The cumulative incidence function for cause j is defined as:

        I(t, j) = P(T <= t and J = j)

    where T is the event time and J is the event type.

    Only right censoring is supported. If frequency weights are provided, the point estimate is returned without a standard error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : array_like
        An array of times (censoring times or event times).
    status : array_like
        If status >= 1 indicates which event occurred at time t. If status = 0, the subject was censored at time t.
    title : str, optional
        Optional title used for plots and summary output.
    freq_weights : array_like, optional
        Optional frequency weights.
    exog : array_like, optional
        Optional covariates used to account for violation of independent censoring.
    bw_factor : float, optional
        Bandwidth multiplier for kernel-based estimation. Only used if exog is provided.
    dimred : bool, optional
        If True, proportional hazards regression models are used for dimension reduction (incomplete in provided code).

Notes
-----

- The module uses Greenwood's formula for standard error estimation when no weights are provided.
- When frequency weights are provided, standard errors are not computed.
- Delayed entry (left truncation) is supported via the `entry` parameter.
- The cumulative incidence function is useful in competing risks analysis where multiple types of events can occur.

Dependencies
------------

- numpy
- pandas
- scipy.stats.distributions
- statsmodels.graphics.utils

This module is intended for survival analysis and competing risks modeling in statistical and biostatistical applications.
