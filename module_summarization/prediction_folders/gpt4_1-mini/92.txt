distutils module
================

This module provides utility functions and classes to assist with building,
installing, and managing Python extensions and libraries, particularly in the
context of NumPy and related projects. It includes facilities for handling
temporary directories, parallel build jobs, path manipulations, and more.

Key Classes
-----------

InstallableLib
    A container class to hold information about an installable library.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the installed library.
    build_info : dict
        Dictionary holding build information.
    target_dir : str
        Absolute path specifying where to install the library.

    Notes
    -----
    The three parameters are stored as attributes with the same names.

    See Also
    --------
    Configuration.add_installed_library


Key Functions
-------------

get_num_build_jobs()
    Determine the number of parallel build jobs to run based on command line
    arguments, environment variables, or system CPU count.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        Number of parallel jobs that can be run, capped at 8 to avoid system overload.

quote_args(args)
    (Deprecated) Quote a list of command line arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : list of str
        List of command line arguments to quote.

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        Quoted arguments.

allpath(name)
    Convert a forward slash (/) separated pathname to one using the OS's path
    separator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Pathname with '/' separators.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Pathname with OS-specific separators.

rel_path(path, parent_path)
    Return the relative path of `path` with respect to `parent_path`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        The path to be made relative.
    parent_path : str
        The base path to which `path` is made relative.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Relative path from `parent_path` to `path`.

get_path_from_frame(frame, parent_path=None)
    Return the path of the module given a frame object from the call stack.

    Parameters
    ----------
    frame : frame object
        Frame object from the call stack.
    parent_path : str, optional
        If given, the returned path is relative to this path; otherwise,
        an absolute path is returned.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Path of the module corresponding to the frame.

njoin(*path)
    Join two or more pathname components, converting '/' separators to the OS
    path separator and resolving '.' and '..' components.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *path : str or sequence of str
        Path components to join.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Joined and normalized path.

Temporary Directory Management
------------------------------

The module manages temporary directories created during build processes, ensuring
that only one temporary directory is created per thread and that all temporary
directories are cleaned up upon program exit.

- `_tdata` (thread-local storage) stores the temporary directory for each thread.
- `_tmpdirs` keeps track of all created temporary directories.
- `clean_up_temporary_directory()` is registered with `atexit` to remove all
  temporary directories on exit.

Module Attributes
-----------------

__all__
    List of public objects of the module, including classes, functions, and
    utilities such as `Configuration`, `get_numpy_include_dirs`, `get_num_build_jobs`,
    `allpath`, `njoin`, and others.

Notes
-----

This module is designed to be used internally by NumPy's distutils system and
related build tools. It provides foundational utilities for managing build
configurations, source files, and installation paths, as well as handling
platform-specific issues and parallel build execution.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- `quote_args` function is deprecated as of version 1.22 and should be avoided
  in new code.
