Using Timers
============

The ftrack API provides convenient support for working with timers to measure and manage time intervals within your applications. Timers can be used to profile code execution, schedule operations, or track elapsed time for various tasks.

Basic Usage
-----------

To use timers, you typically create a timer instance and start it before the code section you want to measure. After the code executes, you stop the timer and retrieve the elapsed time.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    from ftrack_api import Timer

    timer = Timer()
    timer.start()

    # Code to measure
    time.sleep(2)

    timer.stop()
    print('Elapsed time:', timer.elapsed)

Timer Features
--------------

- **Start and Stop**: Begin and end timing intervals explicitly.
- **Elapsed Time**: Retrieve the total time elapsed between start and stop calls.
- **Context Manager Support**: Use timers with Python's `with` statement for automatic start and stop.

Using Timer as a Context Manager
--------------------------------

You can use the timer as a context manager to automatically start and stop timing around a block of code:

.. code-block:: python

    from ftrack_api import Timer

    with Timer() as timer:
        # Code to measure
        do_something()

    print('Elapsed time:', timer.elapsed)

Advanced Timer Usage
--------------------

Timers can be nested or used in combination with other ftrack API features to profile complex workflows or asynchronous operations. They provide a simple and consistent interface for time measurement.

Best Practices
--------------

- Use timers to identify performance bottlenecks in your code.
- Employ context managers for cleaner and safer timing code.
- Combine timers with logging to record timing information for debugging or auditing.

Summary
-------

Timers in the ftrack API offer a straightforward way to measure execution time and manage timing-related tasks. By integrating timers into your workflow, you can gain valuable insights into the performance and behavior of your applications.
