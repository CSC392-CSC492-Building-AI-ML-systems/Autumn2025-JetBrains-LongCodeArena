Gaussian Processes
==================

Gaussian processes (GPs) are a powerful, flexible method for regression and classification tasks. They provide a probabilistic approach to learning in kernel machines, allowing for principled uncertainty estimation and automatic complexity control.

Overview
--------

A Gaussian process defines a distribution over functions, fully specified by a mean function and a covariance function (kernel). The choice of kernel encodes assumptions about the function to be learned, such as smoothness, periodicity, or linearity.

In Gaussian process regression and classification, the kernel function plays a central role by defining the similarity between data points. This similarity measure influences the shape of the functions that the GP can model.

Kernel Engineering
------------------

The kernels provided in this module support kernel engineering, allowing users to construct complex kernels by combining simpler ones. Kernels can be combined using the "+" (sum) and "*" (product) operators, or exponentiated with a scalar using the "**" operator. These operations enable the creation of expressive kernels tailored to specific problems.

Additionally, scalar values can be included in kernel expressions and are automatically converted to constant kernels, simplifying kernel construction.

Hyperparameter Optimization
---------------------------

All kernels support analytic gradient-based hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameters control the behavior of kernels, such as length scales or variance parameters, and tuning them is crucial for good model performance.

The hyperparameter search space is rectangular, defined by lower and upper bounds for each hyperparameter. Alternatively, hyperparameters can be fixed to specific values, excluding them from optimization.

Hyperparameter Specification
----------------------------

Hyperparameters are specified using the `Hyperparameter` class, which encapsulates the name, type, bounds, dimensionality, and whether the parameter is fixed. This structured approach facilitates consistent handling and optimization of kernel parameters.

Example usage of hyperparameters:

```python
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import ConstantKernel, Hyperparameter

kernel = ConstantKernel(constant_value=1.0, constant_value_bounds=(0.0, 10.0))

for hyperparameter in kernel.hyperparameters:
    print(hyperparameter)
```

Base Kernel Class
-----------------

All kernels inherit from the abstract base class `Kernel`, which defines the interface and common functionality for kernels. This includes parameter management and support for kernel composition.

The `Kernel` class ensures that kernels can be seamlessly integrated into Gaussian process models and optimized efficiently.
