How to Generate Schema
======================

This module provides functions to generate and apply SQL schema for a given database client.

Functions
---------

get_schema_sql(client: BaseDBAsyncClient, safe: bool) -> str
    Generates the SQL schema for the specified database client.

    Parameters:
    
    - client: The database client instance for which the schema SQL will be generated.
    - safe: If set to True, the generated SQL will include checks to create tables only if they do not already exist.

    Returns:
    
    - A string containing the SQL commands to create the schema.

generate_schema_for_client(client: BaseDBAsyncClient, safe: bool) -> None
    Asynchronously generates and applies the SQL schema directly to the specified database client.

    Parameters:
    
    - client: The database client instance to which the schema will be applied.
    - safe: If set to True, the schema creation will be done safely by creating tables only if they do not already exist.

    This function logs the generated schema at the debug level before applying it. If the generated schema is not empty, it will be executed on the client.

Usage
-----

1. Use `get_schema_sql` to obtain the SQL schema as a string, optionally ensuring safe creation of tables.
2. Use `generate_schema_for_client` to apply the schema directly to the database asynchronously.

Note
----

- The `safe` parameter helps prevent errors by avoiding attempts to create tables that already exist.
- Logging is performed to help debug the generated schema statements.
