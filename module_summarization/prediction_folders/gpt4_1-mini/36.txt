w_succ — List Successful (Recycled) Segments
=============================================

Synopsis
--------

.. code-block:: console

    w_succ [OPTIONS]

Description
-----------

The `w_succ` command lists segments from WESTPA simulations that have successfully reached a target state, i.e., segments that have been recycled. This tool outputs information about these successful segments for each iteration up to the current iteration.

The output includes the iteration number, segment ID, segment weight, and the final progress coordinate values for each successful segment.

Output Format
-------------

The output is a plain text table with the following columns:

- **column 0:** iteration number  
- **column 1:** segment ID  
- **column 2:** weight of the segment  
- **column >2:** final progress coordinate values of the segment  

Example output header:

    # successful (recycled) segments
    # column 0:    iteration
    # column 1:    seg_id
    # column 2:    weight
    # column>2:    final progress coordinate value

Options
-------

- `-o, --output OUTPUT_FILE`  
  Write the output to the specified file instead of standard output.

Additional options are available through WESTPA's runtime configuration system and the common analysis tool interface.

Usage
-----

Run `w_succ` in the directory of a WESTPA simulation to list all segments that have been recycled (i.e., successfully reached the target state) in each iteration. By default, the output is printed to standard output but can be redirected to a file using the `-o` option.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    w_succ -o successful_segments.txt

This command writes the list of successful segments to `successful_segments.txt`.

Notes
-----

- The command processes all iterations from 1 up to (but not including) the current iteration.
- If no recycled segments are found in an iteration, that iteration is skipped in the output.
- The progress coordinate values are formatted according to their data type for readability.

Logging
-------

The tool uses the logger named `w_succ` for internal logging purposes.
