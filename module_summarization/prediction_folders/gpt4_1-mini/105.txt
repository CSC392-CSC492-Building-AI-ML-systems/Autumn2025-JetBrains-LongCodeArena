Generate Documentation for G-Functions
======================================

This module dynamically generates documentation for a collection of mathematical functions and their associated formulas, designed to be included in Sphinx-generated documentation.

Overview
--------

Upon import, the module constructs a comprehensive docstring that categorizes and presents various functions along with their defining equations. The primary goal is to provide clear, LaTeX-formatted mathematical expressions that describe elementary functions and functions involving specific symbolic components.

Function Categories
-------------------

The functions are grouped into categories based on the symbolic atoms involved in their definitions:

- **Elementary functions:** Functions that do not involve any special symbolic atoms.
- **Functions involving specific symbols:** Functions categorized by the symbolic atoms they contain, with each category clearly labeled by the corresponding symbols rendered in LaTeX.

Documentation Structure
-----------------------

For each category, the documentation lists the functions along with their defining formulas in a clear mathematical format. Each formula is presented as an equation, optionally accompanied by conditions under which the formula holds.

The general format for each entry is:

.. math::

   <formula> = <generated function expression> \quad \text{if } <condition>

where:

- `<formula>` is the symbolic representation of the function.
- `<generated function expression>` is the constructed expression representing the function, potentially a sum of terms.
- `<condition>` specifies any constraints or conditions applicable to the formula; if no condition applies, this part is omitted.

Implementation Details
----------------------

- The module imports necessary components for symbolic manipulation and LaTeX rendering.
- It utilizes a lookup table populated by the `_create_lookup_table` function to gather information about functions and their formulas.
- Functions are sorted and grouped using a default sorting key to ensure consistent ordering.
- LaTeX formatting is applied to all symbolic expressions to ensure proper rendering in the documentation.
- The final generated documentation string is assigned to the module’s `__doc__` attribute, making it available for Sphinx autodoc integration.

Usage
-----

This module is intended to be imported within a Sphinx documentation build environment. Upon import, it automatically generates and provides the documentation string describing the functions and their mathematical relationships, which can then be included in the generated documentation pages.

Example Output Snippet
----------------------

Elementary functions:

.. math::

   f(x) = g(x)

Functions involving `\alpha`, `\beta`:

.. math::

   h(x) = \sum_i a_i f_i(x), \quad \text{if } x > 0

(Note: The above is a representative example; actual functions and conditions depend on the lookup table contents.)

Summary
-------

This module serves as a dynamic documentation generator for mathematical functions, providing well-structured, LaTeX-formatted descriptions suitable for inclusion in technical documentation generated by Sphinx.
