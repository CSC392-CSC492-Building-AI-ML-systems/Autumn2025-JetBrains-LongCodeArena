Nextcord
=======

Nextcord is an easy-to-use, feature-rich, and modern Python library designed for interacting with the Discord API. It allows developers to create bots and automate tasks on Discord servers with simplicity and efficiency.

Introduction
------------

Nextcord provides a comprehensive interface to Discord's features, including guilds, channels, members, activities, invites, and widgets. It is built with type hinting and asynchronous programming in mind, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users.

Key Features
------------

- **Guild Widgets**: Nextcord supports Discord guild widgets, which provide a snapshot of a guild's current state, including online members and accessible voice channels.
- **Partial Objects**: The library includes partial representations of Discord entities such as channels and members, allowing efficient access to essential information without requiring full data.
- **Rich Activity Support**: Nextcord supports various user activities, including Spotify listening status and custom activities.
- **Robust Type Safety**: With extensive use of type annotations and enums, Nextcord ensures code clarity and reduces runtime errors.
- **Easy Mentions and Timestamps**: Convenient properties like `.mention` and `.created_at` provide formatted strings for mentions and creation times.

Widget System
-------------

Nextcord's widget system allows you to access and represent partial data about a guild's channels and members:

- **WidgetChannel**: Represents a partial voice channel in a guild widget, including its ID, name, and position. It supports operations such as equality checks and string representation, and provides a mention string and creation timestamp.
  
- **WidgetMember**: Represents a partial member in a guild widget, including user information, status, nickname, avatar, activity, and voice state (deafened, muted, suppressed). It inherits from the base user class and supports equality, hashing, and string representation.

- **Widget**: Represents the guild widget itself, containing the guild's ID, name, accessible voice channels, and online members. It provides a JSON URL representation and supports equality operations.

Usage Example
-------------

Here is a brief example of how you might interact with widgets in Nextcord:

```python
# Assuming you have a guild object
widget = await guild.widget()
print(f"Guild Name: {widget.name}")
print("Channels:")
for channel in widget.channels:
    print(f"- {channel.name} (ID: {channel.id})")
print("Online Members:")
for member in widget.members:
    print(f"- {member.display_name} (Status: {member.status})")
```
