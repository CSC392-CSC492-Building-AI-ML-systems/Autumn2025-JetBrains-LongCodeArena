Parallel Random Number Generation
=================================

Overview
--------

The `numpy.random` module provides a suite of parallel-capable random number generators (RNGs) designed for high performance and reproducibility in scientific computing. This functionality is implemented through a combination of C libraries and Cython extensions, enabling efficient generation of random numbers across multiple parallel threads or processes.

Core Components
---------------

- **npyrandom Library**  
  The core random number generation algorithms and distributions are implemented in the `npyrandom` static C library. This library includes source files for various distributions and random number generation techniques, such as hypergeometric and multivariate hypergeometric distributions.

- **Cython Extensions**  
  To interface the C implementations with Python, several Cython extension modules are built. These extensions wrap the underlying C code and provide Pythonic APIs for different bit generators and distributions. The extensions include implementations for well-known RNG algorithms such as:
  
  - `MT19937` (Mersenne Twister)
  - `Philox`
  - `PCG64`
  - `SFC64`
  
  Each bit generator is implemented as a separate extension module, combining C source files with Cython `.pyx` files for seamless integration.

Parallelism and Thread Safety
-----------------------------

The design of the `numpy.random` module supports parallel random number generation by allowing multiple independent bit generators to be instantiated and used concurrently. Each bit generator maintains its own internal state, ensuring that random streams do not interfere with each other when used in parallel contexts such as multi-threading or multi-processing.

Installation and Integration
----------------------------

The build system compiles the `npyrandom` library and the associated Cython extensions, installing them into the appropriate directories within the NumPy package structure. The installation includes:

- Core source files and headers
- Cython `.pyx` and `.pxd` files for extension modules
- Python stub files for type hinting and IDE support
- Test suites and test data for validating RNG correctness
- Example scripts demonstrating usage with CFFI, Cython, and Numba

Usage Examples
--------------

Users can create independent random number generator instances using the provided bit generators, enabling parallel random number generation in their applications. For example:

```python
from numpy.random import Generator, PCG64, Philox

# Create independent generators
gen1 = Generator(PCG64(seed=12345))
gen2 = Generator(Philox(seed=67890))

# Use generators in parallel threads or processes
```

This approach ensures reproducible and statistically sound random number streams in parallel computing environments.
