Contributing to Qiskit Metal
============================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Qiskit Metal! This guide provides an overview of how to contribute effectively to the Qiskit Metal project, ensuring that your contributions align with the project's standards and practices.

Project Overview
----------------
Qiskit Metal is a framework for designing superconducting quantum devices. It includes modules for analyses, electromagnetic calculations, and quantization tools, among others. The codebase is maintained under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and contributions must comply with this license.

Code of Conduct
---------------
All contributors are expected to adhere to the Qiskit Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and considerate in all interactions.

Getting Started
---------------
- **Fork the repository**: Create your own copy of the Qiskit Metal repository to work on.
- **Set up your environment**: Install the necessary dependencies and set up your development environment.
- **Understand the codebase**: Familiarize yourself with the structure of Qiskit Metal, including key modules such as `qiskit_metal.analyses`, which contains tools for electromagnetic and quantization analyses.

Development Guidelines
----------------------
- **Coding style**: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- **Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly. Use docstrings to describe modules, classes, functions, and methods. For example, the `cpw_calculations` module includes detailed docstrings explaining the purpose, parameters, and return values of functions like `guided_wavelength` and `lumped_cpw`.
- **Licensing**: Retain the original copyright notice in all modified files. If you alter files, include a notice indicating the changes.
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features or bug fixes to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

Key Modules and Examples
------------------------
- **Analyses Module (`qiskit_metal.analyses`)**: Contains submodules such as `cpw_calculations` and `lumped_capacitive` for electromagnetic and quantization analyses.
- **CPW Calculations (`cpw_calculations`)**: Provides functions to calculate parameters of coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines, such as:
  - `guided_wavelength(freq, line_width, line_gap, substrate_thickness, film_thickness, dielectric_constant=11.45)`: Calculates the guided wavelength, effective dielectric constant, and filling factor for a planar CPW.
  - `lumped_cpw(freq, line_width, line_gap, substrate_thickness, film_thickness, dielectric_constant=11.45, loss_tangent=1e-5, london_penetration_depth=30e-9)`: Computes lumped element equivalents of a CPW, including kinetic inductance, geometric inductance, capacitance, and admittance.

Submitting Contributions
------------------------
- **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests to the main repository with a clear description of your changes.
- **Review Process**: Contributions will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be prepared to engage in discussions and make revisions as needed.
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.
