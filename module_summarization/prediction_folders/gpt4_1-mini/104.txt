Diophantine Equations Module
============================

Overview
--------

This module provides tools for solving Diophantine equations, which are polynomial equations where integer solutions are sought. The main function, `diophantine()`, simplifies the solution process by factoring the equation into terms and solving each term independently.

Key Features
------------

- Supports a variety of Diophantine equation types including:
  - Binary quadratic equations
  - Cubic Thue equations
  - General Pythagorean equations
  - Sums of even powers and sums of squares
  - Homogeneous and inhomogeneous quadratic forms
  - Linear and univariate equations

- Automatically factors equations and solves each factor separately.
- Returns solutions as sets of tuples, with each tuple containing solutions for the variables in alphabetical order.
- Allows specifying a parameter symbol for parametric solutions.
- Supports custom ordering of variables in the output.

Functions
---------

diophantine(eq, param=symbols('t', integer=True), syms=None)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simplifies and solves a Diophantine equation by factoring it into terms and solving each term independently.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

- `eq` : Relational or Expr  
  The Diophantine equation to solve.

- `param` : Symbol, optional  
  The parameter symbol to use in parametric solutions (default is an integer symbol `t`).

- `syms` : list of Symbol, optional  
  Specifies the order of variables in the returned solution tuples.

Returns
^^^^^^^

- A set of tuples, each tuple representing a solution. The elements correspond to the variables in alphabetical order or as specified by `syms`.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

>>> from diofant.abc import x, y, z  
>>> diophantine(x**2 - y**2)  
{(t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0)}

>>> diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))  
{(0, n1, n2), (t_0, t_1, 2*t_0 + 3*t_1)}

>>> diophantine(x**2 + 3*x*y + 4*x)  
{(0, n1), (3*t_0 - 4, -t_0)}

Notes
-----

- The function attempts to factor the polynomial equation and solve each factor.
- If the equation is zero, the trivial parametric solution is returned.
- The function raises a `TypeError` if the input is not a polynomial with rational coefficients.
- Some equation types may not be handled and will raise `NotImplementedError`.
