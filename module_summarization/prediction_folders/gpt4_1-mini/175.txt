Biclustering
============

Biclustering is a data mining technique that simultaneously clusters the rows and columns of a data matrix. Unlike traditional clustering methods that group either rows or columns independently, biclustering identifies submatrices where a subset of rows exhibits similar behavior across a subset of columns. This approach is particularly useful in domains such as bioinformatics, text mining, and collaborative filtering, where patterns may be localized to specific subsets of features and samples.

Overview
--------

Biclustering algorithms aim to find coherent patterns in data by discovering clusters of samples and features that exhibit a specific relationship. These patterns can reveal meaningful structures that are not apparent when clustering rows or columns separately.

Key Characteristics
-------------------

- **Simultaneous Clustering:** Biclustering groups both rows and columns at the same time, identifying submatrices with coherent values.
- **Local Patterns:** It uncovers local patterns that may be hidden in the global data structure.
- **Overlapping Clusters:** Biclusters can overlap, meaning a row or column can belong to multiple biclusters.
- **Flexibility:** Different types of biclusters can be found depending on the coherence criteria, such as constant values, constant rows or columns, or coherent evolutions.

Applications
------------

- **Gene Expression Analysis:** Identifying groups of genes that are co-expressed under specific conditions.
- **Text Mining:** Finding groups of documents and terms that are related.
- **Recommender Systems:** Discovering user-item groups with similar preferences.

Common Biclustering Methods
---------------------------

- **Cheng and Church Algorithm:** Finds biclusters with low mean squared residue.
- **Spectral Biclustering:** Uses singular value decomposition to identify checkerboard patterns.
- **Bimax:** Identifies biclusters with binary data.
- **Plaid Model:** Models data as a sum of layers, each representing a bicluster.

Usage
-----

Biclustering can be applied to a data matrix `X` of shape `(n_samples, n_features)`. The goal is to find subsets of samples and features that form meaningful biclusters.

Example
-------

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_biclusters
from sklearn.cluster import SpectralBiclustering

# Generate synthetic data with biclusters
X, rows, columns = make_biclusters(shape=(300, 300), n_clusters=5, noise=5, shuffle=True, random_state=0)

# Apply Spectral Biclustering
model = SpectralBiclustering(n_clusters=5, method='log', random_state=0)
model.fit(X)

# Rearrange data to show biclusters
fit_data = X[np.argsort(model.row_labels_)]
fit_data = fit_data[:, np.argsort(model.column_labels_)]
```

Notes
-----

Biclustering is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis when the data exhibits complex, localized patterns. Choosing the appropriate biclustering method depends on the data characteristics and the specific application domain.
