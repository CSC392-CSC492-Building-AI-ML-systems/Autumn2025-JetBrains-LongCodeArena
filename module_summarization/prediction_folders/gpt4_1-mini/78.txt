FileNode Module
===============

Overview
--------

The FileNode module provides a file-like interface for working with nodes inside PyTables database files. It allows users to create and manipulate file nodes within HDF5 files using familiar Python file operations.

Key Features
------------

- Create new file nodes using the `new_node()` function.
- Open existing file nodes with `open_node()` for read-only or read-write access.
- Supports reading and appending data to file nodes; write access is limited to appending.
- Binary I/O support only.
- Fully compliant with Python's `io` module interfaces since version 3.0.

Usage
-----

- Use `new_node()` to create a new file node that behaves like a standard Python file.
- Use `open_node()` to open an existing file node for reading or appending.
- Read access is always available.
- Write access is available only for new files or files opened in append mode (`'a+'`).
- The module supports random access, seeking, and truncation (only for growing the file).

Classes
-------

### RawPyTablesIO

A base class for raw binary I/O on HDF5 files using PyTables. It inherits from `io.RawIOBase` and implements the standard file interface methods:

- `mode`: Returns the file mode.
- `tell()`: Returns the current stream position.
- `seek(pos, whence=0)`: Changes the stream position.
- `seekable()`: Returns `True`, indicating support for random access.
- `fileno()`: Returns the underlying file descriptor.
- `close()`: Flushes and closes the IO object.
- `flush()`: Flushes write buffers.
- `truncate(pos=None)`: Truncates the file to the specified size (only supports growing).
- `readable()`: Returns whether the file was opened for reading.
- `writable()`: Returns whether the file was opened for writing.
- `readinto(b)`: Reads bytes into a buffer.
- `readline(limit=-1)`: Reads and returns a line from the stream (implementation incomplete in the provided code).

Attributes
----------

- `NodeType`: A string constant `'file'` used as the value for the `NODE_TYPE` node system attribute.
- `NodeTypeVersions`: A list `[1, 2]` indicating supported values for the `NODE_TYPE_VERSION` node system attribute.

Version Information
-------------------

- The module was completely rewritten in version 3.0 to comply fully with the interfaces defined in Python's `io` module.

Additional Information
----------------------

- Only binary I/O is supported.
- For detailed instructions on usage, see the user guide referenced as :ref:`filenode_usersguide`.
- The module uses PyTables and NumPy for underlying data handling.
- Write operations are limited to appending data; rewriting or deleting data is not supported.

Warnings
--------

- Closing the IO object when the host PyTables file is already closed will issue a warning.

License and Dependencies
------------------------

- Depends on PyTables (`tables`), NumPy, and Python standard libraries such as `io`, `os`, and `pathlib`.

This module facilitates seamless integration of file-like operations within PyTables HDF5 files, enabling efficient and familiar data manipulation workflows.
