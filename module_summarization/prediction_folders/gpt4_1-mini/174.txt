Array API Support
=================

Scikit-learn provides preliminary support for the Array API standard, enabling compatibility with array libraries that implement the Array API specification. This support aims to facilitate interoperability and flexibility in using different array types beyond NumPy arrays.

Overview
--------

The Array API standard defines a common set of array operations and behaviors, allowing libraries to work seamlessly with various array implementations. Scikit-learn's support for the Array API allows users to pass arrays conforming to this standard to estimators and utilities, promoting broader compatibility.

Current Status
--------------

- Core estimators and utilities in scikit-learn accept inputs that implement the Array API.
- Support is designed to be consistent with the scikit-learn API, ensuring familiar usage patterns.
- The implementation leverages duck typing and protocol adherence to detect and operate on Array API-compliant arrays.
- Some advanced features or edge cases may not yet be fully supported; users are encouraged to report issues or contribute improvements.

Usage
-----

To use scikit-learn with Array API-compliant arrays:

1. Ensure your array library implements the Array API specification.
2. Pass arrays from this library directly to scikit-learn estimators and functions.
3. Scikit-learn will internally handle these arrays, performing computations as expected.

Example:

```python
import array_api_compatible_library as aapi
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = aapi.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
y = aapi.array([1, 2, 3])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)
predictions = model.predict(X)
```

Limitations and Compatibility
-----------------------------

- While scikit-learn strives to support the Array API, some estimators or utilities may still expect NumPy arrays or may not fully support all Array API features.
- Performance characteristics may vary depending on the underlying array library.
- Users should verify compatibility for their specific use cases and array implementations.

Future Directions
-----------------

Scikit-learn plans to expand and improve Array API support, including:

- Extending compatibility to more estimators and utilities.
- Enhancing testing and validation with various Array API implementations.
- Collaborating with the Array API community to ensure robust and efficient integration.
