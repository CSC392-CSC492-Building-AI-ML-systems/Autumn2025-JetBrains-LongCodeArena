Compatibility Policy
====================

The `numpy.random` subpackage, including its C extensions and associated libraries, follows a compatibility policy designed to balance stability for users with the ability to improve and optimize the implementation.

Key Points
----------

- **API Stability:**  
  The public Python API exposed by `numpy.random` is intended to remain stable across minor and patch releases. This ensures that user code depending on random number generation continues to function without modification.

- **C API and Internal Changes:**  
  The underlying C libraries and Cython extensions, such as the `npyrandom` static library and various bit generator implementations (`_mt19937`, `_philox`, `_pcg64`, `_sfc64`), may evolve internally. These changes are generally not considered breaking as long as the public Python API remains consistent.

- **Legacy Support:**  
  Legacy components, such as the `mtrand` module, are maintained with explicit flags (e.g., `-DNP_RANDOM_LEGACY=1`) to preserve backward compatibility where feasible. However, users are encouraged to migrate to newer generators and interfaces for improved performance and features.

- **Deprecation Policy:**  
  Deprecated features in the C API or Python interface are clearly marked and phased out over multiple releases, with warnings provided to users. For example, the use of older NumPy C API versions is still supported (`-DNPY_NO_DEPRECATED_API=0`) due to dependencies in Cython code, but this may change in future releases.

- **Installation and Build Compatibility:**  
  The build system uses Meson to compile and install the `npyrandom` static library and Cython extensions. Compatibility is maintained across supported platforms, with platform-specific compiler flags applied as needed (e.g., `-Wl,--export-all-symbols` on Cygwin).

- **Testing and Validation:**  
  A comprehensive suite of tests and test data is included and installed alongside the package to ensure ongoing compatibility and correctness of random number generation algorithms.

- **Dual Licensing:**  
  The software is dual-licensed under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, ensuring broad compatibility with open source projects.

Summary
-------

Users can rely on the stability of the `numpy.random` Python API for their applications. While internal implementations and build details may evolve, these changes are managed carefully to avoid breaking existing code. Users are encouraged to keep their environments updated and to follow deprecation warnings to maintain compatibility with future releases.
