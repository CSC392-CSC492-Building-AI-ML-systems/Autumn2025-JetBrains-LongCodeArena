Channel Options
===============

In Vega-Lite visualizations, **channels** are the visual encoding properties that map data fields to visual properties of marks (such as position, color, size, shape, etc.). Each channel can be configured with various options to control how data is represented visually.

This document provides an overview of the available channel options and their usage.

Common Channel Options
----------------------

- **field**  
  The name of the data field to encode. This is typically a column name in a dataset.

- **type**  
  The type of data in the field. Common types include:  
  - `quantitative` (numeric data)  
  - `ordinal` (ordered categorical data)  
  - `nominal` (unordered categorical data)  
  - `temporal` (time or date data)

- **aggregate**  
  An aggregation function to apply to the data field before encoding. Examples include:  
  - `sum`  
  - `mean`  
  - `median`  
  - `count`  
  - `min`  
  - `max`

- **bin**  
  Whether to bin quantitative data into discrete bins. Can be a boolean or an object specifying bin parameters.

- **timeUnit**  
  For temporal data, a time unit to extract (e.g., year, month, day).

- **scale**  
  Configuration for the scale used to map data values to visual values. This can include scale type, domain, range, and other scale properties.

- **axis**  
  Configuration for the axis associated with the channel, such as axis labels, ticks, grid lines, and orientation.

- **legend**  
  Configuration for the legend associated with the channel, including legend title, symbol type, and layout.

- **sort**  
  Specifies the sort order for ordinal or nominal data.

- **title**  
  A custom title for the channel, overriding the default field name.

Position Channels
-----------------

- **x** and **y**  
  These channels encode the horizontal and vertical positions of marks. They typically require quantitative or temporal data types.

- **x2** and **y2**  
  Secondary position channels used for ranged marks (e.g., bars, areas) to specify the start and end positions.

Color and Appearance Channels
-----------------------------

- **color**  
  Encodes the color of marks. Can be used with nominal, ordinal, or quantitative data.

- **fill** and **stroke**  
  Specify fill and stroke colors separately.

- **opacity**  
  Controls the transparency of marks.

- **size**  
  Encodes the size of marks, often used with quantitative data.

- **shape**  
  Encodes the shape of marks, typically used with nominal or ordinal data.

- **strokeWidth**  
  Controls the width of mark outlines.

- **strokeDash**  
  Specifies dash patterns for lines.

Text Channels
-------------

- **text**  
  Encodes text labels on marks.

- **tooltip**  
  Provides additional information displayed on hover.

Other Channels
--------------

- **order**  
  Controls the layering order of marks.

- **detail**  
  Adds detail to marks without changing their visual appearance, useful for grouping.

- **key**  
  Specifies a key field for linking data points across views or for selections.

Usage Example
-------------

A typical channel definition in a Vega-Lite specification might look like this:

```json
"encoding": {
  "x": {"field": "Horsepower", "type": "quantitative"},
  "y": {"field": "Miles_per_Gallon", "type": "quantitative"},
  "color": {"field": "Origin", "type": "nominal"},
  "size": {"field": "Weight_in_lbs", "type": "quantitative", "scale": {"range": [0, 1000]}}
}
```

This example encodes the `Horsepower` field on the x-axis, `Miles_per_Gallon` on the y-axis, colors marks by `Origin`, and sizes marks by `Weight_in_lbs`.
