Support Vector Machines
=======================

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection. They are particularly well-suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets.

LinearSVC
---------

The `LinearSVC` class implements a linear Support Vector Classification model. It is similar to the `SVC` class with a linear kernel but is implemented using the `liblinear` library rather than `libsvm`. This implementation offers more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and generally scales better to large numbers of samples.

Key Features:
- Supports both dense and sparse input data.
- Handles multiclass classification using a one-vs-the-rest scheme.
- Provides options for different penalties and loss functions.
- Allows control over whether to solve the dual or primal optimization problem.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

- **penalty** : {'l1', 'l2'}, default='l2'  
  Specifies the norm used in the penalization. The 'l2' penalty is the standard used in SVC. The 'l1' penalty leads to sparse coefficient vectors.

- **loss** : {'hinge', 'squared_hinge'}, default='squared_hinge'  
  Specifies the loss function. 'hinge' is the standard SVM loss, while 'squared_hinge' is the square of the hinge loss. Note that the combination of `penalty='l1'` and `loss='hinge'` is not supported.

- **dual** : "auto" or bool, default=True  
  Selects whether to solve the dual or primal optimization problem. It is recommended to set `dual=False` when the number of samples exceeds the number of features. The `"auto"` option chooses the value automatically based on the dataset and parameters.

- **tol** : float, default=1e-4  
  Tolerance for the stopping criteria.

- **C** : float, default=1.0  
  Regularization parameter. The strength of the regularization is inversely proportional to C. Must be strictly positive.

- **multi_class** : {'ovr', 'crammer_singer'}, default='ovr'  
  Determines the multi-class strategy if the target contains more than two classes.  
  - `"ovr"`: trains one-vs-rest classifiers for each class.  
  - `"crammer_singer"`: optimizes a joint objective over all classes. This option is theoretically consistent but rarely used in practice due to computational cost and limited accuracy improvement.

- **fit_intercept** : bool, default=True  
  Whether to fit an intercept term. If True, the feature vector is extended with a constant feature to represent the intercept.

- **intercept_scaling** : float, default=1.0  
  When `fit_intercept` is True, this parameter scales the synthetic feature appended to the instance vector. It affects the intercept term in the model.

Usage Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- The `LinearSVC` class is suitable for large-scale linear classification problems.
- It supports both dense and sparse input formats.
- The choice between dual and primal optimization depends on the shape of the data and the parameters.
- The `"auto"` setting for the `dual` parameter (introduced in version 1.3) will become the default in version 1.5.
- The `"crammer_singer"` multi-class strategy is less commonly used but available for theoretical completeness.
