Miscellaneous Models
====================

This module provides implementations of statistical models that extend classical models by incorporating Student's t-distributed errors. The t-distribution, known for its heavier tails compared to the normal distribution, allows these models to better handle data with outliers or heavier-tailed error distributions, providing more robust parameter estimation.

Linear Model with Student-t Distributed Errors
----------------------------------------------

The `TLinearModel` class implements a linear regression model where the error terms follow a Student's t-distribution. This model is estimated via maximum likelihood using a generic likelihood framework.

Key features:
- Robustness to outliers and heavy-tailed error distributions due to the t-distributed errors.
- Estimation of degrees of freedom (df) parameter, controlling the heaviness of the tails, can be fixed or estimated.
- Scale parameter separate from variance, reflecting the standard t-distribution rather than a standardized version.
- Starting values for parameters can be initialized based on ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates.
- Numerical differentiation is used for gradients and Hessians, enabling computation of standard errors and other statistics.

Univariate ARMA Model with Student-t Distributed Errors
-------------------------------------------------------

The `TArma` class extends the classical ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) time series model by assuming that the innovations (errors) follow a Student's t-distribution instead of a normal distribution.

Key features:
- Inherits most functionality from the standard ARMA implementation, modifying only the likelihood to accommodate t-distributed errors.
- The variance of the errors is related to the scale and degrees of freedom parameters by the formula:  
  \[
  \text{error_variance} = \frac{df}{df - 2} \times \text{scale}^2
  \]
- Provides a more robust modeling approach for time series data with heavy-tailed noise or outliers.
- Uses the standard t-distribution, not a standardized version, for error modeling.

Notes
-----

- Both models use the standard Student's t-distribution, which differs from a standardized t-distribution in that the scale parameter is not equal to the standard deviation.
- The models rely on numerical methods for likelihood optimization and inference.
- The module includes TODOs for enhancements such as improved starting values, parameter restrictions, and potential standardization of the t-distribution.
- These models are useful in applications where robustness to outliers and heavy-tailed error distributions is important.
