Convolution Module Built-in Kernels
===================================

The `astropy.convolution` module provides a collection of built-in kernel classes designed for use with convolution operations on one- and two-dimensional data. These kernels serve as the fundamental building blocks for smoothing, filtering, and other signal processing tasks within the Astropy modeling and convolution framework.

Kernel Classes
--------------

The module includes several kernel base classes and specialized kernels, which can be used directly or extended for custom applications:

- **Kernel**: The base class for all kernels, providing the core interface and functionality.
- **Kernel1D**: A base class for one-dimensional kernels.
- **Kernel2D**: A base class for two-dimensional kernels.

These classes encapsulate the kernel data and provide methods to apply the kernel to input data arrays efficiently.

Kernel Properties and Usage
---------------------------

- Kernels are typically represented as small arrays that define the weighting function applied during convolution.
- The kernel size and shape determine the extent and nature of the smoothing or filtering effect.
- Kernels can be normalized to ensure that the convolution preserves the overall flux or intensity of the input data.
- The module includes utilities to check kernel properties such as size and shape, and to raise exceptions for invalid kernels (e.g., kernels with even-sized axes).

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

The convolution routines in the module are optimized for performance, including:

- Use of fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods for large kernels and data arrays.
- Selection of optimal array sizes for FFT operations to improve computational efficiency.
- Handling of boundary conditions with options such as 'fill', 'wrap', and 'extend'.

Integration with Astropy Modeling
---------------------------------

The convolution kernels integrate seamlessly with the Astropy modeling framework, allowing kernels to be used as models or components within compound models. This integration facilitates complex modeling workflows involving convolution operations.

Error Handling and Warnings
---------------------------

The module provides specific exceptions and warnings related to kernel usage, including:

- `KernelSizeError`: Raised when a kernel does not meet size requirements.
- Warnings for kernels with even-sized axes, which may cause unexpected behavior in convolution.

Summary
-------

The built-in kernels in the `astropy.convolution` module provide a robust and flexible foundation for convolution operations in astronomical data analysis and other scientific computing tasks. Their design emphasizes ease of use, integration with Astropy's modeling tools, and computational efficiency.
