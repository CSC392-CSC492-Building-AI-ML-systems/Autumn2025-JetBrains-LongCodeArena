Quantile Regression Model
=========================

This module implements a Quantile Regression model using iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) for parameter estimation. Quantile regression provides a robust alternative to ordinary least squares regression by estimating conditional quantiles of the response variable, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between variables beyond the mean.

Overview
--------

The core class in this module is `QuantReg`, which extends the `RegressionModel` base class. It estimates quantile regression models by solving the optimization problem through an iterative weighted least squares approach. The model supports estimation of any quantile between 0 and 1, with the special case of the median regression (Least Absolute Deviation, LAD) corresponding to the 0.5 quantile.

Key Features
------------

- **Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS):** Parameters are estimated by iteratively solving weighted least squares problems, updating weights based on residuals until convergence.
- **Asymptotic Covariance Estimation:** The covariance matrix of the parameter estimates is computed using kernel density estimation methods, providing robust standard errors.
- **Kernel Density Options:** Supports multiple kernel functions for density estimation, including Epanechnikov, Cosine, Gaussian, and Parzen kernels.
- **Bandwidth Selection Methods:** Implements several bandwidth selection techniques for kernel density estimation, such as Hall-Sheather, Bofinger, and Chamberlain methods.
- **Robust and IID Variance-Covariance Estimators:** Users can specify the method for variance-covariance matrix calculation, choosing between heteroskedasticity-robust or independent and identically distributed (iid) error assumptions.

Usage
-----

To use the quantile regression model, instantiate the `QuantReg` class with endogenous (response) and exogenous (predictor) variables, then call the `fit` method specifying the desired quantile and other optional parameters:

```python
model = QuantReg(endog, exog)
results = model.fit(q=0.5, vcov='robust', kernel='epa', bandwidth='hsheather')
```

Parameters for the `fit` method include:

- `q` (float): Quantile to estimate, must be between 0 and 1 (default 0.5).
- `vcov` (str): Method for variance-covariance matrix calculation; options are `'robust'` or `'iid'`.
- `kernel` (str): Kernel function for density estimation; options include `'epa'` (Epanechnikov), `'cos'` (Cosine), `'gau'` (Gaussian), and `'par'` (Parzen).
- `bandwidth` (str): Bandwidth selection method; options are `'hsheather'` (Hall-Sheather), `'bofinger'`, and `'chamberlain'`.

Notes
-----

- The Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimator corresponds to the quantile regression with `q=0.5`.
- The asymptotic covariance matrix estimation follows Greene (2008, pp. 407-408).
- The module is designed to handle convergence warnings and iteration limits during the fitting process.
