nextcord — Introduction
=======================

What is nextcord?
-----------------
nextcord is an asynchronous Python wrapper for the Discord API. It provides a high-level, pythonic interface for building Discord bots and applications, exposing core Discord primitives (clients, guilds, members, channels, messages, activities, invites, widgets, etc.) and utilities to handle events, commands, and gateway interactions.

Features
--------
- Asynchronous (async/await) API designed for building responsive bots.
- High-level abstractions for Discord objects: Client/Bot, Guild, Member, Channel, Message, Activity, Invite, Widget, and more.
- Support for rich presence/activity objects (including Spotify presence).
- Extensible command framework (ext.commands) and event handling.
- Lightweight and permissively licensed (MIT).

Installation
------------
Install with pip:

pip install nextcord

Requirements: Python 3.8+.

Quick-start example
-------------------
A minimal bot that prints when it's ready and responds to messages:

from nextcord import Client, Intents

intents = Intents.default()
intents.messages = True

client = Client(intents=intents)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Logged in as {client.user} (ID: {client.user.id})')

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author.bot:
        return
    if message.content.lower() == 'hello':
        await message.channel.send('Hello!')

client.run('YOUR_TOKEN_HERE')

Core concepts
-------------
- Client / Bot: The connection to Discord. Handles events and gateway state.
- Events: Async callbacks for gateway events (on_ready, on_message, on_member_join, etc.).
- Intents: Explicit event subscription for gateway events; configure to receive privileged data.
- Commands: A higher-level framework for parsing and handling prefixed or slash commands.
- Activities: Represent a user's current activity or game. nextcord supports creating Activity objects and parsing Spotify presence.
- Invites: Utilities for resolving and interacting with invite links.
- Widgets: A lightweight representation of a guild's public widget containing partial channel and member data.

Widget API (overview)
---------------------
nextcord exposes widget-related types for accessing a guild widget's partial state:

- Widget
  - Represents a guild widget (a public JSON snapshot).
  - Attributes: id (guild ID), name (guild name), channels (list of WidgetChannel), members (list of WidgetMember).
  - Stringifies to the widget's JSON URL.

- WidgetChannel
  - A partial voice channel representation.
  - Attributes: id, name, position.
  - Properties:
    - mention: returns a channel mention string (<#id>).
    - created_at: creation time derived from the snowflake ID.

- WidgetMember
  - A partial member representation (subclass of BaseUser).
  - Attributes include id, name, discriminator, bot, nick, avatar, status (online/idle/dnd/offline), activity (BaseActivity or Spotify), deafened, muted, suppress, connected_channel.
  - display_name returns nick or username.

Working with activities and presence
-----------------------------------
Activities are represented by nextcord's Activity hierarchy. Presence data may be parsed into BaseActivity or specialized types (e.g., Spotify). Utility helpers create Activity objects from payloads when available.
