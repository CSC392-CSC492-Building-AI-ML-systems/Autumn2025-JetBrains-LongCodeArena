w_succ
======

Synopsis
--------
w_succ [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [WESTPA options] [tool options]

Description
-----------
List segments which successfully (i.e., recycled) reach a target state during WESTPA iterations.
w_succ examines completed iterations (1 .. current_iteration-1) and prints one line per recycled
segment containing the iteration, segment id, segment weight, and the final progress-coordinate
values for that segment.

Options
-------
-o, --output OUTPUT_FILE
    Store output in OUTPUT_FILE (text). Default: write to standard output.

[WESTPA options]
    The command accepts the usual WESTPA runtime configuration options (added via westpa.rc).

[Tool options]
    The tool inherits CommonOutputMixin/WESTDataReaderMixin options (for example, options that
    control header printing and other output details). See the WESTPA tool documentation for
    the full list of inherited options.

Output format
-------------
Unless header printing is suppressed via the tool/common-output options, the output begins with:

# successful (recycled) segments
# column 0:    iteration
# column 1:    seg_id
# column 2:    weight
# column>2:    final progress coordinate value

Each subsequent line corresponds to one recycled (successful) segment and has the form:

    <iteration>    <seg_id>    <weight>    <pcoord_0>    <pcoord_1>    ...

- iteration: integer iteration number (from 1 up to current_iteration - 1)
- seg_id: integer segment index within that iteration
- weight: floating-point segment weight
- pcoord_n: final progress-coordinate components for the segment (formatted by dtype)

Numeric formatting uses type-dependent width/precision for readability.

Behavior details
----------------
- Iterations examined: 1 .. (current_iteration - 1). The current in-progress iteration is not examined.
- A segment is considered “successful” if its endpoint_type equals Segment.SEG_ENDPOINT_RECYCLED.
- For each recycled segment, the tool reads the final progress coordinate (last frame) from the pcoord
  dataset and prints its components.
- If an iteration contains no recycled segments, it is skipped.
- Header output can be suppressed by the common-output/tool options (see inherited options).

Examples
--------
Write successful segments to a file:

    w_succ -o successful_segments.txt

Write to standard output (default):

    w_succ

Notes
-----
- The tool reads WESTPA HDF5 data (segment index and progress-coordinate datasets) via the
  WESTDataReaderMixin; it therefore must be run in a WESTPA run directory or with appropriate
  WESTPA configuration so the data manager can locate the run data.
- Exit status is the process exit code (normally zero on success; failures raise exceptions and
  return non-zero).
