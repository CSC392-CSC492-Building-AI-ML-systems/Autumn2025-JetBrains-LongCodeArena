g-functions
===========

Module purpose
--------------
This module builds a human-readable documentation string that lists Meijer G–related lookup formulas used by the meijerint integration machinery. On import it constructs a mapping of recognizable function patterns to their corresponding g-function representations and renders those relations as LaTeX math blocks in the module docstring.

Synopsis
--------
- A lookup table `t` (a dict mapping tuples of function types to lists of formula entries) is created and populated by a call to the internal helper `_create_lookup_table`.
- Each entry in `t` is a tuple describing a relationship of the form
  (formula, gs, cond, hint)
  where:
  - formula: a SymPy expression (left-hand side of the relation)
  - gs: either a single generated object or a list of `(factor, g-function)` pairs that together form the right-hand side
  - cond: a condition under which the relation holds (True means no condition)
  - hint: an optional integration hint (not rendered into the main output)
- The mapping is iterated in a deterministic order (using `default_sort_key`) and converted into a reStructuredText/LaTeX representation stored in `__doc__`.

Structure of the generated documentation
--------------------------------------
The generated docstring consists of sections, each headed either by

- "Elementary functions:" for the empty `about` key (i.e. relations that do not involve specific special-function atoms), or
- "Functions involving <f1>, <f2>, ...:" for entries whose `about` key lists function atoms. Each function atom is rendered using the package LaTeX printer.

Under each section the module emits one or more math blocks of the form:

.. math::
  <LaTeX of Eq(formula, g)>[, if <LaTeX(cond)>]

Notes on components
-------------------
- formula is printed on the left-hand side of the displayed equation (via the package LaTeX printer).
- The right-hand side is either
  - a generated symbol (when the `gs` value was not a list), printed as a named symbol, or
  - a linear combination Add(factor*G, ...) when `gs` was a list of `(factor, g)` pairs; each `g` is rendered in LaTeX.
- If `cond` is True no condition is shown; otherwise a trailing ", if <cond>" clause is appended (with <cond> rendered in LaTeX).
- Hints are available in the lookup table entries but are not automatically included in the math blocks produced by this module.

Implementation details (concise)
-------------------------------
- Primary imports used to format the output:
  - Symbol, Add, Eq from the core symbolic package
  - latex from the printing subsystem to render expressions into LaTeX
  - default_sort_key to ensure stable ordering of documented groups
- The helper `_create_lookup_table` fills the `t` dictionary with entries used to produce the documentation.
- The final assembled string is written into the module `__doc__` so Sphinx (or other doc-tools) will pick up the generated LaTeX blocks as part of package documentation.

Example fragment (rendered form)
-------------------------------
An example entry in the generated documentation appears as a LaTeX math block, for example:

.. math::
  \mathrm{some\_formula} = \text{generated}

or, when a condition applies:

.. math::
  \mathrm{some\_formula} = \mathrm{combination\_of\_G\_functions},\ \text{ if } \mathrm{some\_condition}

Location of produced documentation
---------------------------------
The complete assembled documentation string is accessible as the module docstring (`__doc__`) after the module is imported; documentation tools that read module docstrings will therefore include the rendered LaTeX relations in the generated docs.
