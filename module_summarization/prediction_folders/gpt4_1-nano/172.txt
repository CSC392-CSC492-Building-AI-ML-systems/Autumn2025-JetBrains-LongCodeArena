SANS to SESANS Conversion
==========================

Introduction
------------
Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and Spin-Echo Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SESANS) are powerful techniques used to investigate structures at the nanoscale. Converting data between SANS and SESANS representations involves mathematical transformations that relate scattering angles and distances to spin-echo measurements.

Overview
--------
The conversion process between SANS and SESANS primarily relies on the relationship between the scattering vector in SANS and the real-space correlation length in SESANS. This involves understanding the geometry of neutron scattering, the wavelength of the neutrons, and the instrumental parameters.

Mathematical Foundations
------------------------
The core of the conversion is based on the following parameters and equations:

- Wavelength (λ): The neutron wavelength used in the experiment.
- Scattering vector (Q): Defined as Q = (4π/λ) * sin(θ/2), where θ is the scattering angle.
- SESANS length scale (z): The real-space distance corresponding to the measured spin-echo length.

The fundamental relation connecting SANS and SESANS is given by:

z = (λ * L) / (2π) * θ

where:
- L is the sample-to-detector distance,
- θ is the scattering angle.

Conversion Procedure
--------------------
1. Measure the scattering intensity as a function of the scattering angle in SANS.
2. Calculate the scattering vector Q for each angle.
3. Convert Q to real-space correlation length z using the relation above.
4. Use the derived z values to interpret SESANS data, which provides information about structures at different length scales.

Implementation Details
----------------------
The conversion involves numerical calculations that account for the neutron wavelength, instrumental geometry, and scattering angles. Proper calibration of the instrument parameters is essential for accurate transformation.
