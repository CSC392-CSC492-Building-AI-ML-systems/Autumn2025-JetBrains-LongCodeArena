Fitting SESANS Data
===================

Introduction
------------
Small-Angle Spin-Echo Neutron Scattering (SESANS) is a powerful technique for probing structures at the nanoscale. Accurate analysis of SESANS data requires fitting models to the experimental measurements to extract meaningful physical parameters. This documentation provides an overview of the process and tools available for fitting SESANS data within the sasmodels framework.

Parameters and Models
---------------------
The fitting process involves various parameters that describe the physical properties of the sample, such as size, shape, and scattering length density. These parameters are used across different models to simulate SESANS signals.

Listing Parameters
------------------
The `list_pars` utility allows users to list all parameters used in the available models. It can display just the parameter names or include the models that utilize each parameter.

Usage:
```bash
python -m sasmodels.list_pars [-v] [volume|orientation|sld|none|any]
```

Options:
- `-v` or `--verbose`: List models that contain each parameter.
- `volume`, `orientation`, `sld`, `none`, `any`: Filter parameters by their type.

Example:
```bash
python -m sasmodels.list_pars -v
```
This command lists all parameters along with the models that use them, providing insight into which parameters influence specific models.

Model Parameters
----------------
Parameters are categorized by their physical type:
- Volume parameters: related to the size and shape of particles.
- Orientation parameters: describe the orientation distribution.
- SLD (scattering length density) parameters: characterize contrast.
- None: parameters not categorized under the above types.
- Any: all parameters regardless of type.

Fitting Procedure
-----------------
The fitting process involves selecting an appropriate model that describes the SESANS data, initializing parameters, and optimizing these parameters to minimize the difference between the model and experimental data. This process can be automated or manual, depending on the complexity of the model and the data quality.

Tools and Functions
-------------------
The sasmodels package provides functions to facilitate model selection, parameter management, and fitting routines. Users can leverage these tools to perform robust and efficient SESANS data analysis.
