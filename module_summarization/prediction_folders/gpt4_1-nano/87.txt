Generate Documentation for Migration Management Module
======================================================

Overview
--------
This module provides classes and functions to manage database migrations, including reversing migrations and checking migration statuses. It is designed to work with the Piccolo ORM framework and supports asynchronous operations.

Classes
-------
BackwardsMigrationManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Handles reversing migrations for a specific app or all apps.

Initialization:
- app_name (str): Name of the application.
- migration_id (str): Specific migration ID to reverse up to ('all', '1', or specific ID).
- auto_agree (bool): If True, automatically confirm prompts.
- clean (bool): If True, delete migration files after reversal.
- preview (bool): If True, only print SQL queries without executing.

Methods:
- run_migrations_backwards(app_config: AppConfig) -> MigrationResult
  Reverses migrations backwards based on the specified migration ID.
- run() -> MigrationResult
  Initiates the reversal process for the specified app.

Functions:
- run_backwards(
    app_name: str,
    migration_id: str = "1",
    auto_agree: bool = False,
    clean: bool = False,
    preview: bool = False
  ) -> MigrationResult
  Entry point to reverse migrations for a specific app or all apps.

- backwards(
    app_name: str,
    migration_id: str = "1",
    auto_agree: bool = False,
    clean: bool = False,
    preview: bool = False
  )
  Asynchronous function that performs the migration reversal with detailed parameters and user prompts.

CheckMigrationManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Handles checking the status of migrations for a specific app.

Initialization:
- app_name (str): Name of the application.

Methods:
- get_migration_statuses() -> List[MigrationStatus]
  Retrieves the status of all migrations for the app, indicating whether each migration has been run.

Data Classes
----------
MigrationStatus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Represents the status of a migration.

Attributes:
- app_name (str): Name of the application.
- migration_id (str): Identifier of the migration.
- description (str): Description of the migration.
- has_ran (bool): Whether the migration has been executed.

Usage
-----
Use the `backwards` function to undo migrations up to a specific migration ID, with options for auto-confirmation, cleaning migration files, and preview mode. The `CheckMigrationManager` can be used to verify the status of migrations for an app.

Note
----
This module relies on asynchronous programming; ensure to run functions within an async context.
