Generate Documentation for diofant.utilities.codegen
======================================================

Overview
--------
The `diofant.utilities.codegen` module provides a framework for generating code in various programming languages such as C, C++, Fortran77, Fortran90, Octave, and Matlab. It is designed to facilitate the translation of diofant expressions into efficient, compilable routines, supporting advanced features like multiple arguments, array handling, and constant evaluation.

Key Features
------------
- Supports multiple target languages with dedicated subclasses of the core code generator.
- Defines a generic `Routine` data structure to describe computational routines comprehensively.
- Provides friendly, high-level functions for routine creation and code generation.
- Supports complex data types, input/output argument handling, and array arguments.
- Capable of isolating and pre-evaluating constants for optimized code.
- Extensible to include user comments, extra include lines, and other customizations.
- Designed to be integrated with the autowrap module for generating `.pyf` files for f2py.

Main Classes
------------
### Routine
A core class representing a computational routine, including its name, arguments, results, local variables, and global variables. It ensures consistency between the symbols used in expressions and the routine's interface, raising errors if inconsistencies are detected.

### DataType and Argument Classes
- `DataType`: Defines data types for routine arguments and results.
- `Argument`, `InputArgument`, `OutputArgument`, `Result`: Describe the nature and role of routine parameters, including input, output, and inout arguments.

### CodeGen and Language-Specific Subclasses
- `CodeGen`: Abstract base class for code generation.
- `CCodeGen`, `FCodeGen`, `OctaveCodeGen`: Implementations for C, Fortran, and Octave/Matlab code generation respectively.

Supported Features and Milestones
---------------------------------
The module is actively developed with several milestones achieved and others planned:
- Completed:
  - Basic scalar input argument code generation in C.
  - Friendly high-level API functions.
  - Support for integer and real number inputs/outputs.
  - Handling of input/output and inout arguments.
  - Proper sorting of arguments.
  - Array argument support with contiguous numpy matrices.
  - Generation of `.pyf` files for f2py via autowrap.
  - Constant isolation and pre-evaluation in double precision.
  - Support for Fortran90 and Octave/Matlab code generation.
- Planned:
  - Implementation of common subexpression elimination.
  - User-defined comments in generated code.
  - Inclusion of extra library/object headers.
  - Compatibility testing across various C compilers and libraries.
  - Support for non-contiguous array arguments.
  - Error handling for untranslatable expressions.
  - Support for complex numbers and default complex data types.
  - Embedding metadata such as date, user, hostname, and hash in headers.
  - Additional language support including C++ and Fortran77.

Usage
-----
The module offers both low-level classes for detailed control and high-level functions such as `codegen()` and `make_routine()` for simplified routine creation and code generation workflows.

This framework aims to streamline the process of translating symbolic expressions into efficient, language-specific routines, enabling seamless integration of diofant computations into larger software projects.
