Synchronizing Users with LDAP
-----------------------------

This feature allows for the synchronization of user accounts in the ftrack system with an external LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directory. By integrating LDAP, organizations can streamline user management, ensuring that user information remains consistent and up-to-date across systems.

Overview
--------

The LDAP synchronization process connects to an LDAP server, retrieves user information, and updates the ftrack user database accordingly. This process can include creating new user accounts, updating existing ones, or deactivating accounts that are no longer present in LDAP.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Access to an LDAP server with appropriate permissions.
- Configuration of LDAP connection parameters such as server URL, bind DN, and credentials.
- Properly configured ftrack environment with necessary permissions to modify user data.

Configuration
-------------

To enable LDAP synchronization, configure the following parameters:

- LDAP server URL
- LDAP bind DN and password
- Search base for user entries
- Attribute mappings (e.g., username, email, full name)

These configurations are typically set in the ftrack configuration files or environment variables.

Usage
-----

1. **Configure LDAP Settings**: Set the LDAP connection parameters in your environment or configuration files.
2. **Run Synchronization**: Execute the LDAP sync command or invoke the relevant API method to start the synchronization process.
3. **Review Results**: Check the synchronization logs and ftrack user management interface to verify that users have been correctly synchronized.

Best Practices
--------------

- Schedule regular synchronization jobs to keep user data current.
- Backup user data before performing bulk updates.
- Use appropriate filters to limit LDAP searches to relevant user groups.
- Handle exceptions and errors gracefully to avoid partial updates.

Additional Notes
----------------

- The synchronization process can be customized to match specific organizational policies.
- It is recommended to test LDAP synchronization in a staging environment before deploying to production.
- Ensure that LDAP attribute mappings align with your LDAP directory schema.
