w_multi_west Command
======================

Overview
--------
The `w_multi_west` command is a specialized tool designed to combine multiple WESTPA simulations while properly accounting for reweighting. It facilitates the aggregation of simulation data stored in multiple HDF5 files, enabling comprehensive analysis across different simulation runs.

Features
--------
- Combines multiple WESTPA simulation datasets into a single output file.
- Supports reweighting of trajectories to ensure accurate statistical representation.
- Allows inclusion of auxiliary datasets for extended analysis.
- Provides options to control reweighting behavior and dataset selection.
- Handles multiple input simulation directories and their associated HDF5 files.

Command-line Options
--------------------
- `-o`, `--output-file` (default: `multi.h5`): Specifies the name of the output HDF5 file where combined results will be stored.
- `-W`, `--west`, `--WEST_H5FILE` (default: `west.h5`): Defines the name of the main HDF5 file inside each simulation directory.
- `-a`, `--aux`: List of additional auxiliary datasets to be combined.
- `-aa`, `--auxall`: Flag to combine all auxiliary datasets.
- `-nr`, `--no-reweight`: Flag to disable reweighting; if set, trajectories are combined without reweighting.
- `-ib`, `--ibstates`: Attempt to combine `ibstates` dataset if present.

Usage
-----
The `w_multi_west` tool is invoked from the command line with the specified options. It reads the input simulation directories, extracts relevant data, performs reweighting if enabled, and writes the combined data into the specified output file.

Implementation Details
----------------------
- Utilizes the `WESTTool` and `WESTMultiTool` classes from the WESTPA toolkit.
- Manages multiple input files and datasets, including auxiliary data.
- Supports flexible dataset handling, including auxiliary datasets and `ibstates`.
- Incorporates progress indicators for user feedback during processing.
- Uses HDF5 I/O operations to read and write simulation data efficiently.

Notes
-----
- Ensure that all input simulation directories contain the specified HDF5 files.
- Reweighting is enabled by default; disable it with the `--no-reweight` flag if desired.
- Auxiliary datasets can be specified multiple times or all datasets can be combined with the `--auxall` flag.
- The tool is designed to facilitate large-scale simulation data analysis, providing a streamlined approach to data aggregation and reweighting.
