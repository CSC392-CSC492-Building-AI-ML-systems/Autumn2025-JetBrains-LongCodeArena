Verification Scheme for FITS Data
===================================

Overview
--------
The verification scheme is designed to ensure the integrity and correctness of FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data. It provides mechanisms to identify, report, and optionally fix issues within FITS files, supporting various levels of strictness and reporting preferences.

Key Components
--------------
- VerifyError and VerifyWarning: Custom exception and warning classes used during verification to signal errors and warnings.
- VERIFY_OPTIONS: List of supported verification options, including ignore, warn, exception, fix, silentfix, and combinations thereof.
- _Verify Class: Contains core methods for executing verification based on selected options, handling error reporting, fixing issues, and managing verification flow.
- _ErrList Class: Manages nested lists of verification errors, allowing structured and indented reporting of issues.

Verification Process
--------------------
The primary method, `verify`, performs comprehensive checks on FITS data elements. It accepts an `option` parameter that determines how issues are handled:
- "ignore": Suppresses all verification messages.
- "warn": Issues warnings for problems.
- "exception": Raises exceptions on errors.
- "fix": Attempts to automatically fix fixable issues.
- "silentfix": Fixes issues silently without reporting.
- Combinations like "fix+warn" or "silentfix+exception" to customize behavior.

The verification process involves:
1. Validating the provided option against supported options.
2. Running the core verification logic (`_verify`) to identify issues.
3. Parsing the option to determine reporting and fixing behavior.
4. Filtering and reporting messages based on the chosen options.
5. Raising warnings or exceptions as configured.

Error Reporting
---------------
Errors are collected in an `_ErrList` object, which supports nested structures for detailed reporting. The `iter_lines` method allows iteration over errors with proper indentation, facilitating clear and hierarchical error messages.

Fixing Issues
--------------
When fix options are enabled, the verification attempts to correct fixable issues automatically. The reporting behavior adjusts accordingly, with silent fixes suppressing output and other options providing warnings or exceptions.

Usage
-----
The verification scheme is integrated into FITS data handling classes, enabling users to perform validation with customizable verbosity and correction levels. It ensures data integrity while providing flexibility for different validation scenarios.

Note
----
This verification framework is part of the larger FITS handling library, leveraging Astropy utilities and adhering to a modular design for extensibility and robustness.
