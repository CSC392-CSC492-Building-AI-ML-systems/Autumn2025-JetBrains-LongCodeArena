Generate Documentation for Polynomial Factorization Routines
=============================================================

Overview
--------

This module provides routines for polynomial factorization in characteristic zero fields. It includes classes and methods to perform trial division, factor multivariate polynomials over algebraic number fields, and factor polynomials over integers using advanced algorithms such as Zassenhaus and Hensel lifting. The implementation supports univariate and multivariate polynomials, with optimizations for specific cases.

Classes
-------

_Factor (Mixin Class)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mixin class that provides core factorization routines used by polynomial classes.

Methods
-------

_trial_division(f, factors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performs trial division of a polynomial `f` by a list of factors.

Parameters:
- `f`: The polynomial to be factored.
- `factors`: A list of factors to divide `f` by.

Returns:
- A sorted list of tuples `(factor, exponent)` representing the factors and their multiplicities.

_aa_factor_trager(f)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Factors multivariate polynomials over algebraic number fields using Trager's algorithm.

Parameters:
- `f`: The polynomial to be factored.

Returns:
- A tuple `(lc, factors)` where `lc` is the leading coefficient, and `factors` is a list of irreducible factors.

_zz_factor(f)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performs complete factorization of polynomials over the integers `Z[X]`.

Parameters:
- `f`: The polynomial to be factored.

Returns:
- A tuple `(content, factors)` where `content` is the content of `f`, and `factors` is a list of irreducible factors with their multiplicities.

Supporting Algorithms and Methods
-------------------------------

_zz_mignotte_bound(f)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculates the Mignotte bound for multivariate polynomials in `Z[X]`, which is used to estimate the size of coefficients during factorization.

_zz_zassenhaus(f)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implements Zassenhaus's algorithm for factoring primitive square-free univariate polynomials over `Z[x]`.

Parameters:
- `f`: The polynomial to be factored.

Returns:
- A list of irreducible factors of `f`.

Notes
-----

- The module relies on several imported functions and classes for number theory, polynomial utilities, and error handling.
- It supports configurable options via the `query` function, such as whether to use irreducibility checks or cyclotomic factorization.
- The algorithms are optimized for different polynomial types and degrees, with fallback strategies for robustness.
- The implementation includes advanced techniques like Hensel lifting, cyclotomic factorization, and trial division to ensure efficient and accurate factorization.
