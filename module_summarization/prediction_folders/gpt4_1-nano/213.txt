Nonparametric Methods
=======================

Overview
--------
Nonparametric methods are statistical techniques that do not assume a specific parametric form for the underlying distribution of the data. These methods are flexible and useful for exploring data distributions, estimating densities, and performing hypothesis testing without relying on strict assumptions.

Univariate Kernel Density Estimation
-------------------------------------
Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a fundamental nonparametric technique for estimating the probability density function of a random variable. It smooths the observed data points using a kernel function, providing a continuous estimate of the underlying density.

Key Features:
- Suitable for univariate data.
- Uses various kernel functions such as Gaussian, Epanechnikov, Uniform, Triangular, Biweight, Triweight, and Cosine.
- Bandwidth selection is crucial; options include "scott," "silverman," "normal_reference," or user-defined values or functions.
- Supports FFT-based computation for efficiency when using Gaussian kernels.
- Provides methods to compute the density and cumulative distribution function (CDF).

Kernel Density Estimator Class
------------------------------
The `KDEUnivariate` class encapsulates the kernel density estimation process for univariate data.

Parameters:
- `endog`: The data for which the density is estimated.

Methods:
- `fit()`: Fits the KDE to the data using specified kernel, bandwidth, and computational options.
- `cdf`: A property that returns the estimated cumulative distribution function evaluated at the support points.

Usage:
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

nobs = 300
np.random.seed(1234)
dens = sm.nonparametric.KDEUnivariate(np.random.normal(size=nobs))
dens.fit()
plt.plot(dens.cdf)
plt.show()
```

Kernel Selection
----------------
The available kernels are:
- Gaussian (`gau`)
- Epanechnikov (`epa`)
- Uniform (`uni`)
- Triangular (`tri`)
- Biweight (`biw`)
- Triweight (`triw`)
- Cosine (`cos`)

Bandwidth Selection
-------------------
Bandwidth controls the smoothness of the density estimate:
- "scott": Scott's rule
- "silverman": Silverman's rule
- "normal_reference": Based on kernel properties
- Float or callable: User-specified bandwidth or function

FFT and Computational Efficiency
---------------------------------
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) can be used for efficient computation, limited to Gaussian kernels in this implementation.
