Using Custom Attributes
=======================

Introduction
------------
Custom attributes in ftrack allow users to extend the default set of entity properties with additional, user-defined data fields. These attributes enable more flexible and tailored workflows by attaching relevant metadata to entities such as assets, tasks, or other ftrack entities.

Creating Custom Attributes
--------------------------
To create a custom attribute, define its properties including name, type, default value, and other optional parameters. Custom attributes can be added to specific entity types or globally available across multiple entities.

Accessing Custom Attributes
---------------------------
Once created, custom attributes can be accessed and manipulated through the ftrack API. They are typically retrieved as part of an entity’s attribute set and can be read or modified programmatically.

Example:
```python
# Accessing a custom attribute value
entity = session.query('Asset where name is "MyAsset"').one()
custom_value = entity['custom_attribute_name']

# Setting a custom attribute value
entity['custom_attribute_name'] = 'New Value'
entity.commit()
```

Managing Custom Attributes
--------------------------
Custom attributes are managed via the ftrack web interface or through the API. You can create, update, or delete custom attributes using the ftrack API by interacting with the relevant entity factories and attribute classes.

Best Practices
--------------
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for custom attributes.
- Define appropriate data types to ensure data integrity.
- Set default values where applicable to streamline data entry.
- Document custom attributes for team clarity and consistency.

Additional Resources
--------------------
For detailed API usage and examples, refer to the ftrack API documentation related to entity attributes and custom attribute management. Proper use of custom attributes enhances data organization and retrieval, supporting more efficient project workflows.
