Generate Documentation for Augmentations Module
===============================================

Overview
--------
This module provides a suite of image augmentation functions designed for use with NVIDIA DALI and AutoAugment policies. The augmentations are implemented as DALI operators and are intended to enhance image datasets for training deep learning models, particularly for ImageNet, RandAugment, and TrivialAugmentWide.

Features
--------
- Implements common image transformations such as shear, translation, rotation, brightness, contrast, and more.
- Uses a decorator `@augmentation` to handle parameter computation and augmentation configuration.
- Supports flexible parameter ranges and random negation for diverse augmentation effects.
- Designed to be easily adjustable for different magnitudes and augmentation strengths.

Augmentation Functions
----------------------
### Shear Transformations
- **shear_x**: Applies shear along the x-axis.
- **shear_y**: Applies shear along the y-axis.

### Translation Transformations
- **translate_x**: Translates images along the x-axis based on relative offset.
- **translate_x_no_shape**: Translates images along the x-axis with explicit offset.
- **translate_y**: Translates images along the y-axis based on relative offset.
- **translate_y_no_shape**: Translates images along the y-axis with explicit offset.

### Rotation
- **rotate**: Rotates images by a specified angle.

### Brightness, Contrast, and Other Enhancements
- **brightness**: Adjusts image brightness.
- **contrast**: Adjusts image contrast, following PIL's implementation with a channel-weighted mean as the contrast center.

Parameter Handling
------------------
Each augmentation function uses the `@augmentation` decorator, which manages parameter scaling, random negation, and conversion from magnitude bins to actual parameters. The decorator allows easy customization of magnitude ranges and augmentation behavior.

Usage
-----
Augmentation functions are designed to be called with a batch of images and relevant parameters. They can be customized by adjusting the `mag_range` and other decorator arguments to suit specific augmentation needs.

Dependencies
------------
- **numpy**: Required for numerical operations.
- **nvidia.dali**: Provides image processing operators.
- **nvidia.dali.auto_aug.core.augmentation**: Decorator for defining augmentations.

Note
----
Ensure that `numpy` is installed in your environment to utilize these augmentations. The functions are optimized for GPU execution via DALI operators, enabling efficient data augmentation pipelines.
