Gaussian Process Kernels
==========================

Overview
--------
This module provides a collection of kernel functions designed for Gaussian process regression and classification tasks. Kernels are fundamental components in Gaussian processes, defining the similarity measure between data points and influencing the properties of the resulting model.

Kernel Composition and Customization
------------------------------------
The kernels in this module support kernel-engineering, allowing users to create complex kernels by combining simpler ones. These combinations can be performed using the following operators:

- Addition (`+`): Represents the sum of kernels, capturing additive effects.
- Multiplication (`*`): Represents the product of kernels, modeling interactions.
- Exponentiation (`**`): Raises a kernel to a scalar power, adjusting its smoothness.

Scalar values can also be included in these expressions, which are automatically converted into constant kernels. This flexibility enables the construction of highly customized kernels tailored to specific problems.

Hyperparameter Optimization
---------------------------
All kernels in this module support analytic gradient-based hyperparameter optimization. Users can specify the search space for hyperparameters by providing lower and upper bounds, forming a rectangular search space. Alternatively, hyperparameters can be fixed, excluding them from the optimization process.

Hyperparameters are represented using the `Hyperparameter` class, which details their name, type, bounds, number of elements (for vector-valued hyperparameters), and whether they are fixed. This structured approach facilitates systematic hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

Classes and Functions
---------------------
- `Hyperparameter`: Defines the properties of a kernel hyperparameter, including name, type, bounds, and whether it is fixed.
- `Kernel`: An abstract base class for all kernel implementations, providing methods for parameter retrieval and management.

Usage
-----
Kernels can be instantiated and combined to form complex similarity functions. Hyperparameters can be tuned within specified bounds or fixed to constant values, enabling flexible model configuration.

Example:
```python
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import ConstantKernel, RBF
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor

# Define a composite kernel
kernel = ConstantKernel(1.0, (0.0, 10.0)) * RBF(length_scale=1.0, length_scale_bounds=(0.1, 10.0))

# Instantiate Gaussian Process Regressor with the custom kernel
gp = GaussianProcessRegressor(kernel=kernel)
```

This module is inspired by the kernel module of the `george` package and is designed to be compatible with scikit-learn's Gaussian process framework.
