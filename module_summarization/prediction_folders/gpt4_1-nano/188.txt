Kernel Approximation Functions
==============================

The `sklearn.kernel_approximation` module provides several classes that implement approximate feature maps for various kernels. These functions enable scalable kernel methods by transforming data into a feature space where linear algorithms can be applied efficiently. The main classes include:

PolynomialCountSketch
---------------------
Implements a polynomial kernel approximation via Tensor Sketch. The polynomial kernel is defined as:

    K(X, Y) = (gamma * <X, Y> + coef0)^degree

This class uses Count Sketch combined with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to efficiently approximate the feature map of the polynomial kernel. It is particularly useful for large-scale problems where exact computation of the kernel matrix is computationally expensive.

Key Parameters:
- `gamma`: Parameter of the polynomial kernel.
- `degree`: Degree of the polynomial.
- `coef0`: Constant term added to the kernel.
- `n_components`: Dimensionality of the output feature space.
- `random_state`: Controls randomness for reproducibility.

Methods:
- `fit(X, y=None)`: Fits the transformer to the data, initializing internal hash functions.
- `transform(X)`: Transforms data into the approximate feature space.

Examples:
```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import PolynomialCountSketch
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier

X = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]]
y = [0, 0, 1, 1]
ps = PolynomialCountSketch(degree=3, random_state=1)
X_features = ps.fit_transform(X)
clf = SGDClassifier(max_iter=10)
clf.fit(X_features, y)
score = clf.score(X_features, y)
```

Other Kernel Approximation Classes
----------------------------------
While not detailed here, the module also includes other classes for kernel approximation such as:
- `AdditiveChi2Sampler`: Approximates the additive chi-squared kernel.
- `Nystroem`: Uses a subset of data to approximate the kernel map.
- `RBFSampler`: Approximates the RBF kernel using random Fourier features.
- `SkewedChi2Sampler`: Approximates the skewed chi-squared kernel.

These classes provide flexible tools for kernel approximation, enabling scalable kernel methods across various applications.
