Generate Documentation for Logging Module
==========================================

Overview
--------
The `Logging` module provides a comprehensive logging setup for applications, supporting console, file, and syslog handlers with flexible configuration options. It enables structured logging, log rotation, and multiple formats, facilitating effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

Classes
-------
### Logging
The `Logging` class initializes and configures logging handlers based on application settings.

#### __init__(self, app)
Initializes the logging system with handlers for console, file, and syslog as configured.

- **Parameters:**
  - `app`: The application instance, which provides the event loop and configuration.

Features
--------
- **Console Logging:** Enabled if the output is a terminal or forced via environment variable.
- **File Logging:** Supports log rotation by size and time intervals, with configurable backup count and format.
- **Syslog Logging:** Supports UNIX socket, TCP, UDP, and UNIX connect/sendto schemes with customizable formats.
- **Log Levels:** Supports standard levels and a custom `NOTICE` level for non-verbose informational messages.
- **Structured Data Formatting:** Uses custom formatters for structured log data.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilizes asyncio for scheduling log rotation and syslog communication.

Configuration
-------------
The module relies on a `Config` object for settings, including:
- `logging:file: path, backup_count, backup_max_bytes, format, datefmt, rotate_every`
- `logging:syslog: enabled, address, format, sd_id`

Usage
-----
Create an instance of `Logging` with the application object to initialize logging:
```python
logger = Logging(app)
```

This setup ensures that logs are captured according to the specified configuration, with support for multiple handlers and formats, aiding in effective application monitoring and debugging.

Note
----
This documentation covers the core features and configuration options of the `Logging` module. For detailed implementation and additional methods, refer to the source code.
