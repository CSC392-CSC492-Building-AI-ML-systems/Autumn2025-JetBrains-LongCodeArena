w_bins Command
==============

Description
-----------
The `w_bins` command is a tool for displaying information and statistics about binning in a WEST simulation. It also allows modification of the binning for the current iteration of a WEST simulation.

Usage
-----
w_bins [subcommand] [options]

Subcommands
-----------
- `info`: Display information about binning.
- `rebin`: Rebuild the current iteration with a new binning.

Options
-------
General options:
- `-n`, `--n-iter` N_ITER: Specify the iteration number to consider (default: current iteration).

For `info` subcommand:
- `--detail`: Show detailed per-bin information in addition to summary information.

For `rebin` subcommand:
- `--confirm`: Commit the revised binning to the HDF5 file; without this, only the calculation and display are performed.
- `--detail`: Show detailed per-bin information.
- `--bins-from-file`: (Suppressed in code) Option to load bin definitions from a file.
- `--target-counts`: Specify target counts for binning.

Functionality
-------------
- Display binning information for a specified iteration, including bin counts, weights, and assignments.
- Rebin the current iteration with a new binning scheme, optionally confirming and saving the changes.
- Retrieve and process target states and segment data for binning operations.
- Support detailed output for in-depth analysis of binning structure.

Notes
-----
- Rebinning is not supported for the first iteration.
- The command interacts with the WESTPA data manager and driver to perform binning operations.
- Changes can be confirmed and saved to the HDF5 data store with the `--confirm` option.
