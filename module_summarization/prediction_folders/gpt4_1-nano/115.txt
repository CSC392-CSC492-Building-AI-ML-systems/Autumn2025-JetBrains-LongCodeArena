Configuration Module
====================

Overview
--------
This module provides methods and classes for managing the global configuration options of the ASDF (Advanced Scientific Data Format) library. It allows users to customize resource mappings, extensions, versioning, and I/O behavior in a thread-safe manner.

Classes
-------
AsdfConfig
~~~~~~~~~~
A container class for ASDF configuration options. Users are not intended to instantiate this class directly; instead, use the `get_config()` and `config_context()` functions to access or modify the global configuration.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~
- resource_mappings: List of registered resource mapping instances. Defaults to mappings registered via entry points.
- resource_manager: Instance of `ResourceManager` that manages resources based on current mappings.
- extensions: List of registered extensions.
- default_version: String representing the default ASDF standard version for new files.
- io_block_size: Integer specifying the block size for I/O operations (-1 for filesystem default).
- array_inline_threshold: Threshold for inlining arrays; defaults to None.

Methods
-------
- add_resource_mapping(mapping)
  Registers a new resource mapping, giving it precedence over existing mappings.
- remove_resource_mapping(mapping=None, package=None)
  Removes specified resource mappings or all mappings from a given package.
- reset_resources()
  Resets resource mappings to the default set provided via entry points.
- add_extension(extension)
  Registers a new extension, giving it precedence over existing extensions.
- remove_extension(extension=None, package=None)
  Removes specified extensions or all extensions from a given package.
- reset_extensions()
  Resets extensions to the default set registered via entry points.
- default_version (property)
  Gets or sets the default ASDF standard version.
- io_block_size (property)
  Gets or sets the block size used during I/O operations.

Functions
---------
- get_config()
  Retrieves the global `AsdfConfig` instance.
- config_context()
  Context manager for temporarily modifying the global configuration.

Usage
-----
The configuration system is designed to be used globally within the application. Users can customize behavior by modifying the configuration via the provided methods and properties, typically within a context manager to ensure temporary changes.

Notes
-----
- Thread safety is maintained through the use of reentrant locks (`threading.RLock`) to prevent race conditions during configuration modifications.
- Resource mappings and extensions are loaded lazily from entry points and can be overridden or extended at runtime.
- Validation of version strings is performed via the `validate_version()` helper function.
