Array API Support
=================

scikit-learn provides support for the Array API, enabling interoperability with various array libraries that conform to the Array API standard. This support allows scikit-learn estimators and utilities to work seamlessly with array objects from different frameworks such as NumPy, CuPy, JAX, and others that implement the Array API.

Key Features:
-------------

- Compatibility with multiple array libraries through the Array API standard.
- Ability to use array objects from supported libraries as input data for estimators.
- Consistent behavior across different array implementations, facilitating flexible and efficient workflows.

Supported Array Libraries:
--------------------------

scikit-learn's Array API support is designed to work with array objects that adhere to the Array API specification. This includes, but is not limited to:

- NumPy
- CuPy
- JAX
- Other libraries implementing the Array API

Usage:
------

To utilize Array API support, ensure that your array objects conform to the Array API standard. scikit-learn will automatically detect and work with compatible array types, enabling you to pass these objects directly to estimators and functions.

Note:
-----

Array API support is part of scikit-learn's ongoing efforts to improve interoperability and flexibility. For the best experience, use array objects that fully implement the Array API specification.
