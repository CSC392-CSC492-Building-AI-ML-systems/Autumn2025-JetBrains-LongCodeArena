Random Projection Module
========================

Overview
--------
The random_projection module provides tools for reducing the dimensionality of datasets using random projection techniques. These methods are computationally efficient and suitable for large-scale data, offering a trade-off between accuracy and processing speed. The core principle relies on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which guarantees that pairwise distances between points are approximately preserved under certain random linear transformations.

Key Features
------------
- Implementation of various random projection transformers, including SparseRandomProjection and GaussianRandomProjection.
- Utility functions to determine the minimal number of components needed for a desired distortion level.
- Support for dense and sparse data formats.
- Compatibility with scikit-learn's estimator API for seamless integration into machine learning pipelines.

Main Components
---------------
### Functions
- **johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim(n_samples, eps=0.1)**  
  Calculates the minimal number of components required to embed data into a lower-dimensional space with a specified distortion level (eps), based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma.

### Classes
- **SparseRandomProjection**  
  Implements a transformer that projects data into a lower-dimensional space using a sparse random matrix, optimizing for speed and memory efficiency.
- **GaussianRandomProjection**  
  Implements a transformer that projects data using a dense Gaussian random matrix, providing a straightforward approach to dimensionality reduction.

Theoretical Background
----------------------
Random projections are grounded in the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which states that a small set of points in high-dimensional space can be embedded into a lower-dimensional space with minimal distortion of pairwise distances. This property enables efficient data processing and analysis in reduced dimensions without significant loss of information.

Usage
-----
The module offers functions and classes to generate random projection matrices, perform transformations, and determine appropriate target dimensions for specific datasets and accuracy requirements.
