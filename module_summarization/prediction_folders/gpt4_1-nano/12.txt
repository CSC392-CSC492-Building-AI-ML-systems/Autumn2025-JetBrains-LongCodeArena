A Quick Dive into Using the ftrack API
=======================================

Introduction
------------
The ftrack API provides a powerful interface for interacting with an ftrack server, enabling automation, data management, and integration within your pipeline. This guide offers a quick overview of how to initialize a session and perform basic operations.

Setting Up a Session
--------------------
To begin using the API, you need to create a session object that manages your connection to the ftrack server. The session requires the server URL, API key, and user information.

Example:
```python
import ftrack_api

session = ftrack_api.Session(
    server_url='https://your.ftrack.server',
    api_key='your_api_key',
    api_user='your_username'
)
```

Parameters:
- **server_url**: The URL of your ftrack server, including port if necessary.
- **api_key**: Your API key for authentication.
- **api_user**: The username associated with your API key.

Environment Variables:
You can also set environment variables (`FTRACK_SERVER`, `FTRACK_API_KEY`, `FTRACK_API_USER`) to avoid passing parameters explicitly.

Authentication
--------------
The session uses `SessionAuthentication` to attach your credentials to each request, ensuring secure communication with the server.

Example:
```python
auth = ftrack_api.SessionAuthentication(api_key, api_user)
```

Interacting with Entities
-------------------------
Once the session is established, you can query, create, update, or delete entities such as projects, assets, or tasks.

Example: Fetch all projects
```python
projects = session.query('Project')
for project in projects:
    print(project['name'])
```

Auto-Populate
-------------
By default, entity attributes are automatically fetched from the server when accessed if they are not already loaded. This behavior can be toggled via the `auto_populate` parameter during session creation.

Event Hub
---------
The API supports an embedded event hub for real-time event publishing and subscribing. You can enable automatic connection to the event server by setting `auto_connect_event_hub=True` during session initialization.

Example:
```python
session = ftrack_api.Session(
    server_url='https://your.ftrack.server',
    api_key='your_api_key',
    api_user='your_username',
    auto_connect_event_hub=True
)
```

Caching
-------
The session supports schema and data caching to improve performance. You can specify a cache directory with `schema_cache_path` or disable caching by setting it to `False`.

Plugins
-------
Plugins can be loaded from specified paths (`plugin_paths`) and can receive custom arguments (`plugin_arguments`) during registration.

Summary
-------
This quick overview covers the essentials to get started with the ftrack API:
- Initialize a session with server URL, API key, and user.
- Use the session to query and manipulate entities.
- Enable event hub for real-time updates.
- Configure caching and plugins as needed.
