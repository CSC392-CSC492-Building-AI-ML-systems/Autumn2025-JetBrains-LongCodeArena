Unfamiliar FITS Data Structures
===============================

This section provides an overview of some of the less frequently used data structures encountered in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files, which are essential for advanced data handling and analysis in astronomy.

_**_ErrList Class**_
---------------------
The `_ErrList` class is a specialized list designed to manage nested error messages generated during data verification processes. It supports hierarchical error reporting by maintaining a nested list structure, allowing users to traverse and interpret complex verification results with appropriate indentation and context.

Key features:
- Stores error messages with associated hierarchy levels.
- Supports iteration over nested errors with indentation for clarity.
- Includes a `unit` attribute to label the type of errors contained.

_**VerifyError and VerifyWarning Classes**_
--------------------------------------------
These classes define custom exceptions and warnings used during data verification:
- `VerifyError`: Raised when verification encounters a critical, unfixable issue.
- `VerifyWarning`: Warns about potential issues that do not halt processing but may require attention.

_**Verification Options and _Verify Class**_
---------------------------------------------
The `_Verify` class provides mechanisms to perform comprehensive verification of FITS data structures, supporting various reporting and fixing options:
- Options like `"ignore"`, `"warn"`, `"exception"`, `"fix"`, and combinations thereof allow flexible handling of verification results.
- Supports automatic fixing of fixable errors, silent fixing, or raising exceptions for unfixable issues.
- Facilitates detailed reporting and warnings to aid in debugging and data integrity checks.

_**Usage Context**_
These data structures are primarily used internally within FITS handling libraries to ensure data consistency, facilitate debugging, and provide detailed feedback during data processing. They are essential for developers and advanced users who need to perform in-depth verification and error analysis of FITS files beyond standard usage.

Understanding these less common structures enhances the ability to manage complex FITS datasets, especially when dealing with custom or non-standard data arrangements, ensuring robust and reliable data analysis workflows.
