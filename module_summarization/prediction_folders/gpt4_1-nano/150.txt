# Supporting Data to Plotting Functions in Multiple Ways

The plotting functions are designed to be highly flexible in accepting various types of data sources. This flexibility allows users to work seamlessly with different data formats and structures, making plotting more convenient and adaptable to diverse workflows.

## Data Input Types

The core class facilitating this flexibility is `PlotData`. It can handle multiple data input types, including:

- **Dictionaries:** Standard Python dicts with keys mapping to data arrays or columns.
- **Pandas DataFrames:** Tabular data structures with labeled columns.
- **Bokeh ColumnDataSource:** Bokeh's data source object for interactive visualizations (if Bokeh is installed).
- **Lists of Data Sources:** Multiple data sources can be managed simultaneously for complex plotting scenarios.

## Data Handling and Normalization

- **Automatic Data Normalization:** When `same_length=True`, the class ensures all data entries have consistent dimensions, raising errors if mismatches are detected.
- **Data Copying:** To prevent unintended side effects, data can be copied during initialization (`copy_data=True`), including Bokeh data sources.
- **Flexible Data Keys:** Users can specify which data columns or keys to use for plotting via keyword arguments. These can be single keys or lists of keys, enabling batch processing of multiple plot sets.

## Multiple Ways to Specify Data

### 1. Using Dictionaries or DataFrames

You can pass a dictionary or DataFrame directly, specifying which columns to use for plotting:

```python
data = {'x': x_array, 'y': y_array}
plot_data = PlotData(data, x='x', y='y')
```

### 2. Using Lists of Data Sources

For multiple datasets, pass a list of data sources, each with its own set of keys:

```python
data_sources = [dict1, dict2]
plot_data = PlotData(data_sources, x='x', y=['y1', 'y2'])
```

### 3. Specifying Multiple Plot Sets

By providing lists for certain keys, multiple plot configurations can be created simultaneously:

```python
plot_data = PlotData(
    data,
    x='x',
    y=['y1', 'y2'],
    color=['red', 'blue']
)
```

This setup allows iterating over `plot_data` to generate multiple plots with different data combinations.

## Iterating Over Data

The `PlotData` class supports iteration, returning data entries with the specified keys. This enables straightforward looping over datasets for plotting:

```python
for entry in plot_data:
    plot(x=entry.x, y=entry.y)
```

## Extensibility

- **Adding New Data Keys:** Users can add additional data keys after initialization unless `strict_data_keys=True`.
- **Custom Data Sources:** The class can handle custom data sources, provided they conform to the expected interface or are supported types.

## Summary

The design of the data handling in plotting functions allows for:

- Direct use of dictionaries, DataFrames, or Bokeh ColumnDataSources.
- Handling multiple datasets simultaneously.
- Flexible specification of data columns via single keys or lists.
- Iterative access to data for plotting, supporting complex multi-plot workflows.

This versatility ensures that users can adapt their data input methods to their specific needs, facilitating efficient and flexible plotting workflows.
