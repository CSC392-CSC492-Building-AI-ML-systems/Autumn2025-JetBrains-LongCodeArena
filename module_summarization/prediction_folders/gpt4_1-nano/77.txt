Generate Documentation for transforms Module
=============================================

Overview
--------
The `transforms` module provides a set of functions and classes for image processing and transformation tasks. It supports operations such as retrieving image dimensions, size, number of channels, and converting images between different formats like PIL Images, numpy arrays, and PyTorch tensors. The module is designed to work seamlessly with both CPU and GPU tensors and supports multiple image formats and interpolation modes.

Classes
-------
InterpolationMode(Enum)
    Defines various interpolation modes used for image resizing and transformations.
    Available modes:
        - nearest
        - nearest-exact
        - bilinear
        - bicubic
        - box
        - hamming
        - lanczos

Functions
---------
get_dimensions(img)
    Returns the dimensions of an image as [channels, height, width].
    Args:
        img (PIL Image or Tensor): The image to be checked.
    Returns:
        List[int]: The image dimensions.

get_image_size(img)
    Returns the size of an image as [width, height].
    Args:
        img (PIL Image or Tensor): The image to be checked.
    Returns:
        List[int]: The image size.

get_image_num_channels(img)
    Returns the number of channels of an image.
    Args:
        img (PIL Image or Tensor): The image to be checked.
    Returns:
        int: The number of channels.

to_tensor(pic)
    Converts a PIL Image or numpy.ndarray to a PyTorch tensor.
    This function does not support torchscript.
    Args:
        pic (PIL Image or numpy.ndarray): Image to be converted to tensor.
    Returns:
        Tensor: Converted image tensor.

pil_to_tensor(pic)
    Converts a PIL Image to a tensor of the same type.
    Note: Performs a deep copy of the underlying array.
    Args:
        pic (PIL Image): Image to be converted to tensor.
    Returns:
        Tensor: The image as a tensor.

Example Usage
-------------
```python
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image

# Load an image using PIL
img = Image.open('path_to_image.jpg')

# Get image dimensions
dims = transforms.get_dimensions(img)
print(f"Image dimensions (C, H, W): {dims}")

# Get image size
size = transforms.get_image_size(img)
print(f"Image size (W, H): {size}")

# Get number of channels
channels = transforms.get_image_num_channels(img)
print(f"Number of channels: {channels}")

# Convert PIL image to tensor
tensor_img = transforms.to_tensor(img)
print(f"Tensor shape: {tensor_img.shape}")

# Convert tensor back to PIL Image if needed
# (using appropriate transforms)
```

This module facilitates flexible and efficient image preprocessing workflows, supporting various image formats and transformation needs.
