Convolution Module Built-in Kernels
====================================

The Convolution module in Astropy provides a set of built-in kernels designed for efficient and effective convolution operations. These kernels are optimized for various use cases in astronomical data processing, enabling users to perform tasks such as smoothing, sharpening, and feature extraction with ease.

Available Kernels
-----------------

The module includes several predefined kernels, each suited for specific types of convolution:

- Gaussian Kernel: Used for smoothing and noise reduction, characterized by a bell-shaped curve.
- Top-Hat Kernel: Suitable for uniform smoothing within a specified radius.
- Mexican Hat Kernel: Useful for edge detection and feature enhancement.
- Other specialized kernels designed for particular convolution needs in astronomical imaging.

Kernel Classes
--------------

The kernels are implemented as subclasses of the base `Kernel`, `Kernel1D`, and `Kernel2D` classes, providing a consistent interface and functionality:

- `Kernel`: The base class for all kernels, defining common properties and methods.
- `Kernel1D`: One-dimensional kernels, typically used for line or spectral data.
- `Kernel2D`: Two-dimensional kernels, used for image data.

Performance Optimization
------------------------

The module includes functions such as `_next_fast_lengths` to determine optimal array sizes for FFT-based convolution, leveraging `scipy.fft.next_fast_len` when available. This ensures that convolution operations are performed efficiently, especially on large datasets.

Boundary Handling
-----------------

Convolution operations can specify boundary conditions through options like `None`, `"fill"`, `"wrap"`, and `"extend"`. These options control how the edges of the data are treated during convolution, affecting the resulting data near the borders.

Usage
-----

Built-in kernels can be instantiated and used directly in convolution operations. They are designed to be flexible and can be combined with other modeling tools within the Astropy framework for advanced data analysis.

Note
----

The module also includes utility functions and constants to support kernel creation and optimization, ensuring that users can perform high-performance convolution tailored to their specific data and scientific requirements.
