w_states Command
==================

Description
-----------
The `w_states` command is used to display or manipulate basis (initial) and target (recycling) states for a WEST simulation. By default, it displays the current states or dumps them to files. The command supports replacing or appending states for the next iteration.

Modes of Operation
------------------
- `--show`: Display current basis and target states or dump them to specified files.
- `--append`: Append new basis or target states to the existing ones.
- `--replace`: Replace current basis or target states with the specified ones.

Arguments
---------
- `--bstate-file BSTATE_FILE`: Read or write basis state information from/to the specified file.
- `--bstate`: Add a basis state, specified as `'label,probability[,auxref]'`. Can be used multiple times.
- `--tstate-file TSTATE_FILE`: Read or write target state information from/to the specified file.
- `--tstate`: Add a target state, specified as `'label,pcoord0[,pcoord1[,...]]'`. Can be used multiple times.

Usage
-----
The command can be used to:
- Show current basis and target states.
- Save states to files for inspection or editing.
- Replace existing states with new ones, either from files or command-line specifications.
- Append new states to existing ones for the next iteration.

Notes
-----
- Appending basis states is not permitted directly; instead, use the `--show` option to export states, edit the files, and then use `--replace` to update.
- When replacing states, probabilities are checked to ensure they sum to one; if not, they are rescaled accordingly.
- The command interacts with the WESTPA data and simulation managers to perform these operations within the context of a running simulation environment.
