w_fluxanl
==========

Synopsis
--------
w_fluxanl [options]

Description
-----------
The `w_fluxanl` command is a tool for extracting fluxes into predefined target states from WEST simulation data. It computes average fluxes and constructs confidence intervals, utilizing Monte Carlo bootstrapping to account for statistical errors that may be correlated or non-Gaussian in nature.

This command processes data from WEST HDF5 files, analyzing flux information across specified iteration ranges. It supports handling different file versions, ensuring compatibility with older and newer data formats.

Key Features
------------
- Extracts fluxes for specified iteration ranges.
- Computes statistical measures including averages and confidence intervals.
- Uses Monte Carlo bootstrapping to accurately estimate uncertainties.
- Supports output in various formats, including HDF5.
- Handles different data file versions seamlessly.

Usage
-----
The command can be invoked with various options to specify input data, iteration ranges, output preferences, and analysis parameters. Typical usage involves setting the data source, defining the iteration range, and selecting output options.

Options
-------
- `-d`, `--data`: Specify the data source or data manager.
- `--iter-start`: Define the starting iteration for analysis.
- `--iter-stop`: Define the ending iteration for analysis.
- `-o`, `--output`: Specify output file or group.
- `--target`: Define target states for flux analysis.
- `--alpha`: Set the significance level for confidence intervals.
- `--autocorrel-alpha`: Set the significance level for autocorrelation analysis.
- `--n-sets`: Number of bootstrap samples to generate.
- `--do-evol`: Enable evolution analysis over iterations.
- `--evol-step`: Define the step size for evolution analysis.

Output
------
The output includes estimated fluxes, confidence intervals, and autocorrelation lengths, providing insights into the flux behavior over the simulation period. Results are available in terminal output and optionally in HDF5 format, with versioning support for compatibility.

Notes
-----
- The analysis assumes a propagation/resampling period `tau` of unity; to convert results to physical units, multiply fluxes and correlation lengths by the true `tau`.
- The tool is designed to be integrated into workflows for analyzing WEST simulation data, facilitating detailed flux analysis and statistical validation.

Examples
--------
```bash
w_fluxanl --data my_data.h5 --iter-start 10 --iter-stop 100 --output flux_results.h5
```

This command extracts fluxes from iterations 10 to 100 in `my_data.h5`, computes statistical measures, and saves the results to `flux_results.h5`.
