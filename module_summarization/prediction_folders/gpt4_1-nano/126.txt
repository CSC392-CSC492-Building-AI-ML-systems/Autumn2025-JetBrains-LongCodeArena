Data Component in an Image HDU
===============================

Overview
--------
The Data component in an Image Header Data Unit (HDU) represents the primary image data stored within the HDU. It contains the pixel values that form the core visual or scientific information of the image. This component is typically stored as a multi-dimensional array, with the data type and shape specified in the header.

Attributes
----------
- **data**: The main image data array, usually a NumPy ndarray. It holds the pixel values and can be of various data types such as integers or floats.
- **shape**: A tuple indicating the dimensions of the data array, e.g., (naxis1, naxis2) for 2D images.
- **dtype**: The data type of the array elements, such as `np.uint16`, `np.float32`, etc.
- **header**: The header associated with the HDU, containing metadata about the data array, including dimensions, data type, and other relevant information.

Functions
---------
- **get_data()**: Retrieves the image data array from the HDU.
- **set_data(array)**: Sets or updates the image data array within the HDU.
- **verify()**: Validates the integrity and consistency of the data component, ensuring it matches the header specifications.

Usage
-----
The Data component is essential for reading, manipulating, and writing image data in FITS files. It allows users to access pixel values directly, modify the image, or perform analysis. Proper verification ensures that the data conforms to the expected format and dimensions, preventing errors during processing.

Notes
-----
- The data array can be compressed or uncompressed depending on the HDU's configuration.
- The data type and shape are critical for correct interpretation of the image.
- Modifications to the data array should be followed by verification to maintain consistency.

Example
-------
```python
# Accessing the data array from an HDU
image_data = hdu.data

# Modifying the data
hdu.data = new_data_array

# Verifying the data integrity
hdu.verify()
```

This component is fundamental for handling image data within FITS files, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of astronomical images.
