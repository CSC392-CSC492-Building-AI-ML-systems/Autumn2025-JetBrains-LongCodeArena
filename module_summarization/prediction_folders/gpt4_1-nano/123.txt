=====================================

Implements the Preview + Confirm + Delete Workflow
---------------------------------------------------

The delete view provided by this implementation facilitates a user-friendly workflow for deleting objects, incorporating a preview step, a confirmation prompt, and the actual deletion process.

Workflow Overview:
------------------

1. Preview Step:
   - When a user initiates a delete action, the view presents a preview of the object to be deleted.
   - The preview is generated by the `get_object_preview()` method, which returns a string representation of the object.
   - The preview helps users verify that they are deleting the correct item.

2. Confirmation Step:
   - The view displays a confirmation message asking the user to confirm the deletion.
   - The message is generated by the `get_confirm_message()` method, which includes the object preview.
   - Users are prompted with options to proceed with deletion or cancel the operation.
   - The labels for the confirm and cancel buttons are customizable via `get_delete_button_label()` and `get_cancel_button_label()`.

3. Deletion and Post-Deletion:
   - Upon user confirmation, the `delete()` method is invoked.
   - The object is deleted, and a success message is added to inform the user of the successful deletion.
   - The user is redirected to a success URL, typically the app's index page, as defined by `get_success_url()`.

Key Features:
-------------

- Customizable page title, action label, and button labels to suit different contexts.
- Dynamic generation of confirmation messages that include object details.
- Integration with Django's messaging framework to display success messages after deletion.
- Context data preparation for rendering templates, including object preview, success URL, and labels.
- Support for role-based access control via `WithinRoleDeleteView`, ensuring only authorized users can perform deletions.

This workflow ensures a clear, safe, and user-friendly process for deleting objects within Django applications, with flexibility for customization and role-based permissions.
