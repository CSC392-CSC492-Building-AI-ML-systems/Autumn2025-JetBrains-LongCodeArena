Migrating to Nextcord
======================

Introduction
------------

Nextcord is a maintained fork of the Discord.py library, providing an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the Discord API. When migrating from Discord.py to Nextcord, it is important to understand the similarities and differences in the API, as well as the new features and improvements.

Key Concepts and Components
---------------------------

Widgets
-------

Nextcord provides classes to represent and interact with Discord widgets, which are small, embeddable components that display information about a guild or channel.

- **WidgetChannel**: Represents a partial view of a channel within a widget.

  Attributes:
  - `id`: The channel's ID.
  - `name`: The channel's name.
  - `position`: The position of the channel.

  Methods:
  - `__str__()`: Returns the channel's name.
  - `mention`: Property that returns a mention string for the channel.
  - `created_at`: Property that returns the creation time of the channel in UTC.

- **WidgetMember**: Represents a partial member of a guild's widget.

  Attributes:
  - `id`: Member's ID.
  - `name`: Username.
  - `discriminator`: Discriminator.
  - `bot`: Boolean indicating if the member is a bot.
  - `status`: Member's status (`Status` enum).
  - `nick`: Nickname.
  - `avatar`: Avatar hash.
  - `activity`: Current activity (`BaseActivity` or `Spotify`).
  - `deafened`: Deafened status.
  - `muted`: Muted status.
  - `suppress`: Suppressed status.
  - `connected_channel`: The channel the member is connected to (`WidgetChannel`).

  Methods:
  - `__repr__()`: String representation.
  - `display_name`: Property returning the display name (nickname or username).

- **Widget**: Represents a guild's widget.

  Attributes:
  - `id`: Guild ID.
  - `name`: Guild name.
  - `channels`: List of `WidgetChannel` objects.
  - `members`: List of `WidgetMember` objects.

  Methods:
  - `__str__()`: Returns the widget's JSON URL.
  - `__repr__()`: String representation.

Migration Tips
--------------

- Update your imports to use Nextcord instead of Discord.py.
- Replace any widget-related code with the corresponding Nextcord classes (`Widget`, `WidgetMember`, `WidgetChannel`).
- Ensure that your code handles the new attributes and methods provided by Nextcord.
- Review the handling of member statuses, activities, and connected channels to utilize the updated API.
