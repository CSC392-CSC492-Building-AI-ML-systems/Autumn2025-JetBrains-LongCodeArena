# Pairwise Metrics, Affinities, and Kernels

This section provides an overview of pairwise metrics, affinity functions, and kernel functions used in machine learning algorithms for measuring similarity or dissimilarity between data points.

## Pairwise Metrics

Pairwise metrics are functions that compute the distance or similarity between pairs of samples. They are fundamental in clustering, nearest neighbors, and other algorithms that rely on measuring the relationship between data points.

### Common Pairwise Metrics
- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Cosine Similarity
- Hamming Distance
- Jaccard Similarity

### Usage
Pairwise metrics typically accept two input arrays, `X` and `Y`, representing sets of samples. The functions ensure that inputs are valid, properly formatted, and compatible in dimensions before computing the metric.

### Input Validation
The functions `check_pairwise_arrays` and `check_paired_arrays` are used to validate and prepare input data:
- Convert inputs to numpy arrays or sparse matrices.
- Check for finite values unless explicitly allowed.
- Ensure matching dimensions or appropriate precomputed distance matrix shapes.
- Handle sparse formats and data types efficiently.

## Affinities

Affinity functions are specialized similarity measures that often serve as kernels or basis functions in algorithms like spectral clustering or kernel methods.

### Common Affinity Functions
- Radial Basis Function (RBF) or Gaussian Kernel
- Polynomial Kernel
- Sigmoid Kernel

### Characteristics
- Measure the similarity between data points.
- Often parameterized (e.g., gamma in RBF).
- Can be converted into a kernel matrix representing pairwise affinities.

## Kernels

Kernels are functions that implicitly map data into higher-dimensional spaces to make linear separation possible. They are central to kernel methods such as Support Vector Machines.

### Types of Kernels
- Linear Kernel
- Polynomial Kernel
- RBF (Gaussian) Kernel
- Sigmoid Kernel
- Custom kernels

### Kernel Computation
Kernel functions compute the similarity between pairs of samples, often using the same input validation procedures as pairwise metrics. Efficient implementations leverage fast algorithms and sparse matrix operations when applicable.

### Usage in Machine Learning
Kernels enable algorithms to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit transformation, facilitating complex decision boundaries and pattern recognition.
