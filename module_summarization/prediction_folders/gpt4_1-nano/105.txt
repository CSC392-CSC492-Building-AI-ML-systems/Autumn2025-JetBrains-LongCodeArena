Generate Documentation for G-Functions
=======================================

This section provides an overview of the generated mathematical functions and their relationships as constructed by the module.

Elementary Functions
--------------------

The following are elementary functions that serve as the foundational building blocks for more complex expressions:

  \text{(list of elementary functions with their LaTeX representations)}

Functions involving specific operations:
------------------------------------------

The table below lists functions involving particular operations or combinations, along with their corresponding formulas and conditions:

.. math::
  \text{(list of functions with their LaTeX formulas and conditions)}

Note:
-----

- If a function's generated expression (`g`) is not explicitly provided, it defaults to a symbolic placeholder indicating a generated expression.
- Conditions associated with functions are displayed in LaTeX format, specifying when certain formulas apply.

This documentation is dynamically generated to reflect the current set of functions and their relationships as defined in the code.
