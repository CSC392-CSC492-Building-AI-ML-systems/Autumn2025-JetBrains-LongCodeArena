Plothist Command
=================

Overview
--------
The `plothist` command is a versatile tool for visualizing histogram data stored in HDF5 files. It allows users to generate various types of plots, including heatmaps and contour plots, to analyze the distribution of data across different dimensions and iterations.

Features
--------
- Supports input from HDF5 files containing histogram data.
- Allows plotting for specific dimensions with customizable ranges and labels.
- Provides options for different plot scales, including linear, energy (logarithmic), and log10.
- Enables plotting over specified iteration ranges or at specific iteration points.
- Supports output in various formats, including PDF plots and HDF5 data files.
- Offers the ability to overlay contour plots on heatmaps for 2D data.
- Includes a post-processing hook to modify plots programmatically before saving.

Usage
-----
The command requires at least the input HDF5 file containing histogram data. Optional arguments include:

- `firstdim`: Specifies the dimension to plot, with optional range and label.
- `-o` or `--output`: Sets the filename for the output plot (default: `hist.pdf`).
- `--hdf5-output`: Stores plot data in an HDF5 file.
- `--plot-contour`: Overlays a contour plot on 2D heatmaps.
- `--title`: Adds a title to the plot.
- `--linear`, `--energy`, `--log10`: Sets the scale of the plot.
- `--zero-energy`: Defines the zero point for energy scale (`min`, `max`, or a specific value).
- `--range`: Sets the plotting range for axes.
- `--postprocess-function`: Names a function to modify the plot before saving.

Configuration
-------------
The command is configured via argument parsing, with options grouped into input, output, and plot settings. It reads histogram data from the specified HDF5 file, processes the data according to the provided parameters, and generates the corresponding plot.

Example
-------
```bash
plothist input.h5 0 --plot-output=histogram.pdf --title="Histogram of Dimension 0" --energy --range=0,10
```

This example plots the first dimension from `input.h5` with an energy scale, custom range, and saves the plot as `histogram.pdf`.

Notes
-----
- The command supports plotting for specific iterations or averaging over ranges.
- The `postprocess-function` allows for custom modifications to the plot, such as adding annotations or adjusting aesthetics.
- Plotting can be suppressed by setting the output filename to an empty string.
