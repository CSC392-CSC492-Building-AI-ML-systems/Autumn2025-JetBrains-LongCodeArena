Generate Documentation for Diophantine Module
=============================================

Overview
--------
The diophantine module provides functions to solve Diophantine equations—polynomial equations with integer solutions. It simplifies the process of finding solutions by converting equations into factored forms and solving each factor independently. The primary functions include `diophantine()` for solving equations and `classify_diop()` for classifying the type of Diophantine equations.

Functions
---------
diophantine(eq, param=symbols('t', integer=True), syms=None)
    Simplifies and solves a Diophantine equation.
    Converts the equation into a product of terms that should equal zero.
    Solves each term independently using `diop_solve()` and combines solutions.
    Returns a set of tuples, each tuple representing a solution for the variables.

    Parameters:
        eq (Relational or Expr): The equation to be solved.
        param (Symbol, optional): The parameter symbol used in solutions (default: t).
        syms (list of Symbols, optional): Specifies the order of variables in the output.

    Examples:
        >>> diophantine(x**2 - y**2)
        {(t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0)}

        >>> diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))
        {(0, n1, n2), (t_0, t_1, 2*t_0 + 3*t_1)}

        >>> diophantine(x**2 + 3*x*y + 4*x)
        {(0, n1), (3*t_0 - 4, -t_0)}

Supporting Functions
--------------------
_is_int(i)
    Checks if the input can be interpreted as an integer.
    Returns True if convertible to int, False otherwise.

_sorted_tuple(*i)
    Returns a sorted tuple of the input elements.

_remove_gcd(*x)
    Removes the greatest common divisor (GCD) from the input integers.
    Returns a tuple of integers divided by their GCD.

_rational_pq(a, b)
    Returns the numerator and denominator of the rational number a/b with GCD removed.
    Sign is stored in the numerator.

_nint_or_floor(p, q)
    Computes the nearest integer to p/q.
    In case of a tie, returns the floor value.

_odd(i)
    Checks if an integer is odd.
    Returns True if odd, False otherwise.

_even(i)
    Checks if an integer is even.
    Returns True if even, False otherwise.

Usage Notes
-----------
- The `diophantine()` function is designed to handle polynomial equations with rational coefficients.
- It attempts to classify the type of the equation to determine the appropriate solving strategy.
- The function supports equations involving multiple variables and can handle various forms, including quadratic and linear equations.
- Solutions are returned as sets of tuples, with each tuple representing a distinct solution set for the variables.
- The module relies on symbolic computation and algebraic manipulation to simplify and solve equations efficiently.
