Imputation of Missing Values
============================

Introduction
------------
Handling missing data is a common challenge in data analysis and machine learning. Imputation is a technique used to fill in missing values with plausible estimates, enabling algorithms to work effectively without being hindered by incomplete data. The scikit-learn library provides robust tools for imputation, primarily through the `SimpleImputer` class, which supports various strategies for replacing missing values.

Imputation Strategies
---------------------
The `SimpleImputer` class offers several strategies for imputing missing data:

- **Mean**: Replaces missing values with the mean of each column. Suitable for numerical data with a symmetric distribution.
- **Median**: Uses the median of each column to fill missing values. Useful for numerical data with outliers.
- **Most Frequent**: Fills missing entries with the most common value in each column. Applicable to both numerical and categorical data.
- **Constant**: Replaces missing values with a specified constant value, which can be a string or a number.

Parameters
----------
- **missing_values**: Specifies the placeholder for missing data. Can be `np.nan`, `None`, `pandas.NA`, or other sentinel values.
- **strategy**: Defines the imputation method (`"mean"`, `"median"`, `"most_frequent"`, `"constant"`).
- **fill_value**: When using the `"constant"` strategy, this value replaces all missing entries.
- **copy**: If `True`, the imputer creates a copy of the data; otherwise, imputation may be performed in-place.

Implementation Details
----------------------
The imputation process involves the following steps:

1. **Fitting**: The imputer computes the necessary statistics (mean, median, or mode) from the training data.
2. **Transforming**: Missing values in new data are replaced using the fitted statistics or the specified constant.
3. **Indicator Support**: Optionally, an indicator mask can be generated to identify which values were imputed. This is controlled via the `add_indicator` parameter.

Usage Example
-------------
```python
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Create an imputer with median strategy
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')

# Fit the imputer on training data
imputer.fit(X_train)

# Transform the data, replacing missing values
X_imputed = imputer.transform(X_test)
```

Additional Features
-------------------
- **In-place Imputation**: When `copy=False`, imputation can modify the original data directly.
- **Handling Sparse Data**: The imputer supports sparse matrices, enabling efficient imputation in high-dimensional datasets.
- **Feature Name Support**: When used with pandas DataFrames, feature names are preserved and can be retrieved after transformation.

Best Practices
--------------
- Choose the imputation strategy based on the data distribution and type.
- Use the `add_indicator=True` option if it is important to track which values were imputed.
- Always fit the imputer on training data to prevent data leakage and then transform both training and test data accordingly.
