Using Review Sessions
=======================

Overview
--------
Review sessions in ftrack provide a structured way to facilitate project reviews, approvals, and collaborative feedback. They enable teams to organize, track, and manage review processes efficiently within the ftrack environment.

Creating a Review Session
--------------------------
To initiate a review session, establish a session with the ftrack server by providing the necessary connection parameters such as server URL, API key, and user credentials. Once connected, you can create a new review session object, specifying relevant details like the review name, description, and associated assets or entities.

Managing Review Participants
----------------------------
Invite team members or stakeholders to participate in the review session by adding them as participants. Participants can be assigned roles such as reviewer, approver, or observer, depending on their involvement in the review process.

Adding Content for Review
-------------------------
Attach assets, versions, or other relevant entities to the review session. This allows reviewers to access the content directly within the session, facilitating streamlined feedback and discussion.

Conducting the Review
---------------------
Participants can provide feedback, approve, or reject content directly within the review session. The system supports annotations, comments, and status updates, enabling clear communication and decision-making.

Tracking Progress and Outcomes
------------------------------
Monitor the status of review items, track participant actions, and record decisions. The review session can generate reports or summaries to document the review process and outcomes.

Integrating with ftrack API
---------------------------
Utilize the ftrack API's session management capabilities to automate review workflows, integrate with other tools, or extend review functionalities. The API provides methods to create, update, and manage review sessions programmatically.

Best Practices
--------------
- Clearly define review objectives and criteria before starting a session.
- Invite the appropriate stakeholders to ensure comprehensive feedback.
- Regularly update the review status and communicate decisions.
- Use the API to automate repetitive tasks and maintain consistency.

By leveraging review sessions within ftrack, teams can enhance collaboration, ensure accountability, and streamline the review and approval process across projects.
