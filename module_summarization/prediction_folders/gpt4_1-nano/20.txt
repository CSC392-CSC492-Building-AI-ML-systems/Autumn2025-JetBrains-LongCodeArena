w_direct Command
==================

Overview
--------
The `w_direct` command is used to calculate state-to-state kinetics by tracing trajectories within a weighted ensemble simulation. It processes bin assignment files (typically "assign.h5") to generate fluxes, transition event durations, and related kinetic data. The output is stored in an HDF5 file (default "direct.h5") containing various datasets that describe the fluxes, arrivals, durations, and event durations between states.

Subcommands
-----------
- `init`: Submits a set of calculations to be bootstrapped for a specific type of kinetic analysis. It prepares the data for subsequent processing and analysis.

Output Format
-------------
The output file includes the following datasets:

- `/conditional_fluxes` [iteration][state][state]
  - Floating-point values representing macrostate-to-macrostate fluxes (not normalized by initial macrostate populations).

- `/conditional_arrivals` [iteration][stateA][stateB]
  - Integer counts of trajectories arriving at `stateB` from `stateA` during each iteration.

- `/total_fluxes` [iteration][state]
  - Floating-point total flux into each macrostate per iteration.

- `/arrivals` [iteration][state]
  - Integer counts of trajectories arriving at each state per iteration, regardless of origin.

- `/duration_count` [iteration]
  - Integer count of recorded event durations in each iteration.

- `/durations` [iteration][event duration]
  - Structured data containing:
    - `istate`: Initial state of the transition (Integer)
    - `fstate`: Final state of the transition (Integer)
    - `duration`: Duration of the transition in units of tau (Floating-point)
    - `weight`: Trajectory weight at the end of the transition (Floating-point, not normalized)

Usage
-----
The `w_direct` command is typically used in conjunction with other commands such as `w_assign` to generate the necessary input files. It provides detailed kinetic information that can be further processed to obtain rates and fluxes, accounting for statistical fluctuations and correlations.

Options
-------
Refer to the command-line help (`w_direct --help`) for detailed options and parameters to customize the analysis, including bootstrap settings, iteration ranges, and output configurations.

Note
----
The datasets generated by `w_direct` are not normalized by initial macrostate populations. To obtain rates, further normalization using the `w_direct kinetics` command is required.
