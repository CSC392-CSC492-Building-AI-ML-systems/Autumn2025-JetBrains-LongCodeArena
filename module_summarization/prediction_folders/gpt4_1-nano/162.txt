Parallel Random Number Generation
===================================

Introduction
------------
Parallel random number generation is essential for high-performance computing applications that require stochastic simulations, Monte Carlo methods, and other probabilistic algorithms. Efficiently generating independent and reproducible random sequences across multiple processing units is critical to ensure the correctness and reproducibility of scientific computations.

Library Overview
----------------
The `npyrandom` library provides a comprehensive suite of tools for parallel random number generation in Python, leveraging Cython extensions and optimized C implementations. It includes various high-quality pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) such as Mersenne Twister (MT19937), Philox, PCG64, and SFC64, each designed for different performance and statistical properties.

Components
----------
### C Source Files
The core of the `npyrandom` library is built from multiple C source files that implement the underlying distributions and algorithms:
- `logfactorial.c`
- `distributions.c`
- `random_mvhg_count.c`
- `random_mvhg_marginals.c`
- `random_hypergeometric.c`

These files provide efficient implementations of statistical distributions and random sampling methods necessary for parallel RNGs.

### Cython Extensions
The library uses Cython to create Python bindings for the C implementations, enabling seamless integration with NumPy and Python code:
- `_bounded_integers.pyx` and associated `.pxd` files facilitate generating bounded integers efficiently.
- Generator modules such as `_mt19937`, `_philox`, `_pcg64`, and `_sfc64` wrap respective C implementations, providing user-friendly interfaces.
- `_common.pyx` and `bit_generator.pyx` contain shared utilities and the core bit generator logic.

### Build and Installation
The build process compiles the C sources into static libraries and then creates Cython extension modules, which are installed into the `numpy/random` subdirectory. This setup ensures that the random number generators are optimized for performance and can be used in parallel computing environments.

Usage
-----
The `npyrandom` library supports multiple PRNG algorithms, each suitable for different parallelization strategies:
- **MT19937**: The Mersenne Twister, known for its long period and good statistical properties.
- **Philox**: A counter-based generator suitable for GPU and multi-core environments.
- **PCG64**: A modern generator with excellent statistical quality and performance.
- **SFC64**: A fast generator with good statistical properties for simulations.

These generators can be instantiated and used independently or in combination to produce independent streams of random numbers across multiple processes or threads.

Testing and Examples
--------------------
The package includes extensive tests to verify the correctness and independence of generated sequences:
- `test_direct.py`, `test_generator_mt19937.py`, `test_random.py`, and others ensure the reliability of each generator.
- Data files such as `mt19937-testset-1.csv` provide test vectors for validation.

Examples demonstrate how to extend and integrate the random number generators with other Python tools, including CFFI, Cython, and Numba, facilitating flexible and efficient parallel random number generation workflows.

Licensing
---------
This software is dual-licensed under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License, allowing for both open-source use and integration into proprietary applications.

Conclusion
----------
The `npyrandom` library offers a robust, high-performance solution for parallel random number generation, supporting a variety of algorithms optimized for multi-core and distributed computing environments. Its modular design, extensive testing, and compatibility with Python's scientific stack make it an essential tool for scientific computing and simulation tasks requiring reliable parallel randomness.
