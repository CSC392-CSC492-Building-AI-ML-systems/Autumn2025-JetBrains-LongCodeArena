Feature Extraction from Text
=============================

Overview
--------
The `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` submodule provides utilities to convert text documents into numerical feature vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms. It includes a variety of vectorizers, transformers, and preprocessing functions designed to handle common text processing tasks.

Main Components
---------------
- Vectorizers:
  - `CountVectorizer`: Converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.
  - `HashingVectorizer`: Produces a sparse matrix of features using a hash function, suitable for large datasets.
  - `TfidfVectorizer`: Transforms text to a TF-IDF representation, emphasizing important words.
- Transformers:
  - `TfidfTransformer`: Converts a count matrix to a normalized TF-IDF representation.
- Utilities:
  - `ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS`: A set of common English stop words.
  - Text preprocessing functions such as `strip_accents_unicode`, `strip_accents_ascii`, and `strip_tags`.

Key Functions
-------------
- `_preprocess(doc, accent_function=None, lower=False)`: Applies optional preprocessing steps such as lowercasing and accent normalization to a document.
- `_analyze(doc, analyzer=None, tokenizer=None, ngrams=None, preprocessor=None, decoder=None, stop_words=None)`: Processes a document through a series of optional steps to produce tokens or n-grams.
- `strip_accents_unicode(s)`: Converts accented Unicode characters into their simple counterparts, supporting a wide range of characters.
- `strip_accents_ascii(s)`: Transliterates accented characters into ASCII equivalents, suitable for languages with direct transliteration.
- `strip_tags(s)`: Removes HTML or XML tags from a string using regular expressions.
- `_check_stop_list(stop)`: Validates and returns a stop words list, supporting built-in options like `"english"`.

Classes and Mixins
------------------
- `_VectorizerMixin`: Provides common tokenization and decoding logic for text vectorizers, including methods to decode input documents and generate n-grams from tokens.

Usage
-----
These utilities and classes facilitate the transformation of raw text data into structured numerical formats, enabling effective application of machine learning models to text classification, clustering, and other natural language processing tasks.

Note
----
For serious HTML/XML preprocessing, external libraries such as `lxml` or `BeautifulSoup` are recommended instead of the basic `strip_tags` function provided here.
