Basics Indexing
================

Introduction
------------
The `recfunctions` module provides a collection of utilities designed to manipulate structured arrays in NumPy. These functions facilitate operations such as filling fields recursively, extracting field specifications, retrieving field names (including nested structures), flattening data-type descriptions, and more. Originally developed by John Hunter for matplotlib, these utilities have been rewritten and extended for enhanced convenience and functionality.

Functions
---------
### recursive_fill_fields
Fills fields from an output array with data from an input array, supporting nested structured arrays. The function ensures that the output array is at least the same size as the input and copies data recursively for nested fields.

**Parameters:**
- `input` (ndarray): The source array containing data to fill.
- `output` (ndarray): The target array to be filled.

**Notes:**
- Supports nested structures.
- Example usage demonstrates filling a larger array with data from a smaller array.

### _get_fieldspec
Generates a list of `(name, dtype)` pairs corresponding to the fields of a given data-type, handling subarray dtypes. This is useful for reconstructing data-types or inspecting their structure.

**Parameters:**
- `dtype` (np.dtype): The data-type to analyze.

**Returns:**
- List of tuples with field names and their corresponding dtypes.

### get_names
Retrieves the field names of a structured data-type as a tuple, including nested fields. Raises an error if the data-type has no fields.

**Parameters:**
- `adtype` (np.dtype): The input data-type with fields.

**Returns:**
- Tuple of field names, with nested structures represented as nested tuples.

### get_names_flat
Returns a flattened tuple of all field names in a structured data-type, including nested fields. Useful for obtaining a simple list of all field names regardless of nesting.

**Parameters:**
- `adtype` (np.dtype): The input data-type with fields.

**Returns:**
- Tuple of flattened field names.

### flatten_descr
Flattens a structured data-type description into a list of `(name, dtype)` pairs, including nested fields. This simplifies complex data-type descriptions for easier processing.

**Parameters:**
- `ndtype` (np.dtype): The structured data-type to flatten.

**Returns:**
- Tuple of `(name, dtype)` pairs representing all fields in a flattened manner.

Additional functions (not fully detailed here) include utilities for joining, merging, renaming, repacking, and stacking arrays, as well as converting between structured and unstructured formats.

Usage
-----
These utilities are particularly useful when working with complex structured arrays that contain nested fields, enabling easier data manipulation, extraction, and transformation. They are essential tools for advanced data processing tasks in scientific computing, data analysis, and visualization workflows involving structured data.
