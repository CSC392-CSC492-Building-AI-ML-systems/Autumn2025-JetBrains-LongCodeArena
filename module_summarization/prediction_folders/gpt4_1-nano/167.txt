Conventions for the Control Systems Library
=============================================

This document outlines the coding and documentation conventions followed in the Control Systems Library to ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability across all modules and components.

1. Module Structure and Organization
-------------------------------------
- Each module should have a clear purpose and be organized logically.
- Module docstrings should provide a brief overview of the module's functionality, including key classes, functions, and usage notes.
- Import statements should be grouped and ordered: standard library imports, third-party imports, and local imports.

2. Naming Conventions
---------------------
- Classes should follow the CapWords (CamelCase) convention, e.g., `OptimalControlProblem`.
- Functions and variables should use lowercase with underscores, e.g., `sample_system`, `prewarp_frequency`.
- Constants should be written in uppercase with underscores, e.g., `__all__`, `_optimal_defaults`.

3. Documentation Style
----------------------
- All public functions and classes must have docstrings following the NumPy/SciPy documentation style.
- Docstrings should include sections: Parameters, Returns, Notes, Examples.
- Use clear and descriptive parameter names and document their expected types and units.
- Include usage examples where appropriate to illustrate typical use cases.

4. Code Formatting
------------------
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Limit line length to 79 characters.
- Include blank lines to separate top-level functions and class definitions.

5. Error Handling
-----------------
- Validate input parameters and raise appropriate exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`) with informative messages.
- Use custom exceptions where applicable, such as `ControlNotImplemented`.

6. Module and Package Metadata
------------------------------
- Include module-level docstrings with copyright, author, date, and version information.
- Use consistent formatting for metadata and version control identifiers.

7. Licensing and Copyright
--------------------------
- Include licensing information at the top of each source file.
- Follow the specified license terms for redistribution and modification.

8. Code Comments
----------------
- Use comments sparingly and only to clarify complex logic.
- Comment on the purpose of code blocks, especially where the intent may not be immediately clear.

9. Compatibility and Portability
--------------------------------
- Write code that is compatible with Python 3.x.
- Avoid platform-specific code unless necessary, and document such cases.

10. Testing and Examples
------------------------
- Provide example code snippets in docstrings to demonstrate function usage.
- Ensure examples are executable and illustrate typical use cases.

Adherence to these conventions will facilitate collaboration, code review, and future development efforts within the Control Systems Library.
