Pipelines and Composite Estimators
====================================

Overview
--------
The `sklearn.pipeline` module provides utilities to construct composite estimators, enabling the chaining of multiple data transformation steps and a final estimator into a single, cohesive object. This approach facilitates streamlined workflows, reproducibility, and hyperparameter tuning across multiple stages of a machine learning pipeline.

Pipeline Class
--------------
The `Pipeline` class allows you to assemble a sequence of data transformations and a final estimator. Each step in the pipeline must implement `fit` and `transform` methods, except for the final estimator, which only needs to implement `fit`. The pipeline ensures that data flows seamlessly through each step, applying transformations before fitting or predicting with the estimator.

Key Features:
- Sequential application of transforms and estimators.
- Ability to cache intermediate results with the `memory` parameter, improving efficiency for time-consuming transformations.
- Parameter setting using `'__'` notation to specify parameters for individual steps.
- Compatibility with cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

Example Usage:
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X, y = make_classification(random_state=0)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0)

pipe = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('svc', SVC())
])

# Fit the pipeline
pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the pipeline
score = pipe.score(X_test, y_test)

# Set parameters for grid search
pipe.set_params(svc__C=10).fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Attributes:
- `named_steps`: Access individual steps by name.
- `classes_`: Class labels (if the last step is a classifier).
- `n_features_in_`: Number of features seen during fit.
- `feature_names_in_`: Names of features seen during fit.

Methods:
- `set_output(transform=None)`: Configure the output format of the transform methods, supporting formats like `"default"` or `"pandas"`.

Advantages:
- Simplifies complex workflows by encapsulating multiple steps.
- Facilitates hyperparameter tuning across different stages.
- Ensures consistent data processing during training and testing.

Composite Estimators
--------------------
Composite estimators, such as `Pipeline`, enable the construction of complex models by combining multiple transformers and estimators into a single object. This modular approach promotes code reuse, clarity, and maintainability.

Use Cases:
- Sequential data transformations followed by a predictive model.
- Combining feature extraction, selection, and classification/regression steps.
- Creating reusable components for machine learning workflows.

Summary
-------
The `sklearn.pipeline` module's `Pipeline` class is a fundamental tool for building robust, maintainable, and efficient machine learning workflows. By chaining multiple steps into a single estimator, it simplifies model development, evaluation, and deployment processes.
