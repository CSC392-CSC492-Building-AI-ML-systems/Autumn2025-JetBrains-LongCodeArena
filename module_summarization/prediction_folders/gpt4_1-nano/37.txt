w_trace
=======

The `w_trace` command is a tool for analyzing and visualizing the trajectory segments within the WESTPA simulation framework. It provides functionality to trace the history of specific segments back to their origin, enabling detailed examination of the trajectory pathways and their associated data.

Features:
- Construct trajectory traces from data stored in HDF5 files.
- Retrieve segment-specific data slices for analysis.
- Generate time series data along a trajectory for various datasets.
- Support for handling auxiliary files and multiple data formats.
- Efficiently navigate through iteration groups and segment hierarchies.

Usage:
- Initialize a `Trace` object using the `from_data_manager` class method, specifying the iteration number and segment ID.
- Access segment summaries, initial states, and basis states for detailed inspection.
- Extract specific data slices or timepoint datasets for visualization or further analysis.

This command is essential for researchers needing to backtrack segments, analyze their properties, and understand the underlying dynamics of their simulations in a detailed and systematic manner.
