w_ipa
=====

w_ipa (WESTPA Interactive Python Analysis) is a powerful command-line tool designed for interactive analysis of WESTPA simulation data. It provides a comprehensive environment to run traces, examine weights, progress coordinates, and other essential properties of your simulation in a flexible and user-friendly manner.

Features
--------

- Access and modify current iteration, analysis schemes, states, and bins.
- Run detailed traces over specific segments to analyze their history.
- Visualize data using different interfaces, including matplotlib or terminal plotting.
- Manage analysis configurations and reanalyze data with options to ignore hashes or force reanalysis.
- Generate unique hashes for argument sets to track changes and manage file updates.
- Seamlessly integrate with WESTPA's data structures and analysis schemes.

Usage
-----

Initialize w_ipa in your environment to start analyzing your WESTPA data:

.. code-block:: python

    from westpa.cli import w_ipa
    w = w_ipa.WIPI()

Access current properties:

.. code-block:: python

    print(w.iteration)        # Current iteration
    print(w.scheme)           # Current analysis scheme
    print(w.states)           # Defined states
    print(w.bin_labels)       # Bin labels

Modify properties:

.. code-block:: python

    w.iteration = 100       # Set to a new iteration
    w.scheme = 'my_scheme'  # Change analysis scheme

Run a trace for a specific segment:

.. code-block:: python

    trace_info = w.trace(seg_id)

Configure analysis options via command-line arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    w --analysis-only
    w --reanalyze
    w --ignore-hash
    w --debug
    w --terminal

Advanced features include hashing argument sets to detect changes and re-stamping data files accordingly, ensuring efficient reanalysis workflows.

Note
----

w_ipa is designed to be used within a WESTPA analysis environment, providing an interactive and scriptable interface to facilitate detailed and efficient data analysis workflows.
