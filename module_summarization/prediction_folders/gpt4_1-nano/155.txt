Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the Mitogen library! This guide will help you set up and begin using Mitogen for efficient process communication and management.

Introduction
------------
Mitogen is a Python library designed to facilitate communication between master and child processes, often used in automation, orchestration, and remote execution scenarios. It provides a robust framework for managing process hierarchies, connections, and data transfer.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Python 2.4 or higher
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Access to the command line and system configuration

Installation
------------
Mitogen can be installed via pip or by cloning the repository:

```bash
pip install mitogen
```

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dw/mitogen.git
cd mitogen
python setup.py install
```

Basic Usage
-----------
Mitogen's core functionality involves establishing master and child processes that communicate efficiently. The library includes modules for process management, connection handling, and data serialization.

Example: Starting a Mitogen process
```python
import mitogen
from mitogen.parent import connect

# Connect to a remote host or start a local process
connection = connect('ssh://user@host')

# Send commands or data
connection.call('some_function', arg1, arg2)

# Close the connection
connection.close()
```

Configuration
-------------
Mitogen allows configuration of process behavior, connection parameters, and system-specific settings. For example, it detects if SELinux is enabled and adjusts socketpair usage accordingly.

Advanced Features
-----------------
- Support for minification and source code management
- Compatibility with different Python versions
- System-specific optimizations and error handling

Troubleshooting
---------------
- Ensure your Python environment is correctly configured.
- Check system limits for open files and PTYs if encountering resource errors.
- Review logs for warnings related to sys.executable or system configuration.
