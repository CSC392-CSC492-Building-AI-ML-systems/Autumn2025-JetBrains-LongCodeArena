Empirical Likelihood
======================

Overview
--------
Empirical likelihood (EL) is a nonparametric method of statistical inference that allows for hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction for various descriptive statistics such as the mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and correlation. This approach does not rely on parametric assumptions about the underlying data distribution, making it a flexible tool for statistical analysis.

Features
--------
- Conducts hypothesis tests on descriptive statistics.
- Constructs confidence intervals for parameters like mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and correlation.
- Supports multivariate data analysis.
- Integrates with matplotlib for visualization, including multivariate confidence region plots and mean-variance contour plots (if matplotlib is installed).

Implementation Details
----------------------
The core of the empirical likelihood inference is encapsulated in the `DescStat` class, which provides an interface for conducting inference on descriptive statistics. Depending on the data dimensionality, it returns either a univariate (`DescStatUV`) or multivariate (`DescStatMV`) instance.

The `_OptFuncts` class contains functions used in the optimization process to maximize the empirical likelihood. It includes methods for computing the log 'star' of the probabilities, the Hessian, and the gradient of the likelihood, as well as a modified Newton's method for finding the optimal Lagrange multipliers (eta).

Key Functions and Methods
-------------------------
- `DescStat(endog)`: Initializes an inference object for the provided data array `endog`. Returns a univariate or multivariate instance based on data shape.
- `_log_star(eta, est_vect, weights, nobs)`: Computes the transformed log probabilities in terms of the Lagrange multiplier.
- `_hess(eta, est_vect, weights, nobs)`: Calculates the Hessian matrix of the weighted empirical likelihood.
- `_grad(eta, est_vect, weights, nobs)`: Computes the gradient of the weighted empirical likelihood.
- `_modif_newton(eta, est_vect, weights)`: Performs a modified Newton's optimization to find the Lagrange multiplier that maximizes the profile likelihood.

Note
----
This module is designed to be integrated into larger statistical analysis workflows. It provides a flexible and robust framework for empirical likelihood inference on a variety of descriptive statistics without assuming specific parametric models.
