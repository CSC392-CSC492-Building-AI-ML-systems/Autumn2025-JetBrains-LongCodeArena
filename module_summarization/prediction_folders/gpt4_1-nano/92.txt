distutils Module Documentation
===============================

Overview
--------
The `distutils` module provides support for building and installing Python modules into an existing Python installation. It includes utilities for managing build processes, handling configuration, and interacting with the system environment to facilitate the distribution of Python packages.

Key Components
--------------
- **InstallableLib**: A container class that holds information about an installable library, including its name, build information, and target installation directory.
- **get_num_build_jobs()**: Determines the optimal number of parallel build jobs based on system resources and environment variables.
- **quote_args(args)**: Deprecated function for quoting command-line arguments.
- **allpath(name)**: Converts a pathname with '/' separators to the OS-specific path separator.
- **rel_path(path, parent_path)**: Computes the relative path from `parent_path` to `path`.
- **get_path_from_frame(frame, parent_path=None)**: Retrieves the filesystem path of a module given a frame object, optionally relative to a parent path.
- **njoin(*path)**: Joins multiple path components, resolving `..` and `.` segments, and converting '/' to the OS-specific separator.

Utilities and Support Functions
-------------------------------
The module includes various utility functions for path manipulation, environment querying, and system interaction, such as:
- Handling temporary directories with cleanup registered at program exit.
- Managing build configuration and environment variables.
- Converting argument lists for subprocess calls.
- Determining system capabilities like CPU count and affinity.

Usage
-----
This module is typically used internally by setup scripts and build processes to facilitate the compilation, configuration, and installation of Python extension modules and libraries. It provides foundational support for more complex build systems and distribution workflows.

--------
- `distutils.errors`: Contains error classes used throughout the distutils package.
- `distutils.command`: Modules defining various build commands.
- `numpy.distutils`: Extensions to distutils for building NumPy and related packages.

Note
----
This module is part of the standard Python distribution and is primarily intended for use by package maintainers and developers involved in building and distributing Python packages.
