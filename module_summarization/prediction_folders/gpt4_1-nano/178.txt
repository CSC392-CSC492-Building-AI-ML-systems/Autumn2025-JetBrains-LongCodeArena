# Computational Performance

This section provides an overview of the computational performance considerations and dependencies relevant to the implementation and usage of the multioutput estimators in scikit-learn.

## Dependencies and Environment

The performance of multioutput estimators can be influenced by the underlying libraries and their versions. The minimum required dependencies for optimal performance are specified as follows:

- **NumPy**: Version 1.17.3 or higher (1.19.2 for PyPy)
- **SciPy**: Version 1.5.0 or higher
- **Joblib**: Version 1.1.1 or higher
- **Threadpoolctl**: Version 2.0.0 or higher
- **Cython**: Version 0.29.33 or higher

Additional dependencies such as `matplotlib`, `scikit-image`, `pandas`, and others are recommended for enhanced functionality, visualization, and testing.

## Performance Considerations

- **Parallel Processing**: The estimators support parallel execution via the `n_jobs` parameter, enabling multi-core processing to improve training and prediction times.
- **Meta-Estimators**: The multioutput estimators are meta-estimators that extend single-output estimators. Their performance depends on the base estimator's efficiency and the complexity of the multioutput task.
- **Data Handling**: Efficient data structures, such as sparse matrices (`scipy.sparse`), are utilized to optimize memory usage and computation speed, especially for high-dimensional or sparse data.

## Optimization Tips

- Use appropriate `n_jobs` settings to leverage multiple CPU cores.
- Ensure dependencies are up-to-date to benefit from performance improvements in underlying libraries.
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks, especially when working with large datasets or complex models.
- Consider data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction to reduce computational load.

## Additional Notes

- The implementation relies on cloning estimators and supports partial fitting, which can be advantageous for large datasets or online learning scenarios.
- Compatibility and performance may vary depending on the specific combination of estimator, data, and environment.

By adhering to these guidelines and ensuring the environment meets the specified dependencies, users can optimize the computational performance of multioutput estimators in scikit-learn.
