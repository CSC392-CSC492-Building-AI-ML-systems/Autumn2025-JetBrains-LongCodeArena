Publishing Versions
===================

This documentation provides an overview of the versioning and release management for the ftrack API Python package.

Versioning Scheme
-----------------

The ftrack API Python package follows semantic versioning, which is structured as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. This scheme helps users understand the level of change and compatibility between different releases.

- MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are introduced.
- MINOR version when functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.
- PATCH version when backward-compatible bug fixes are made.

Release Process
---------------

The release process involves several stages to ensure stability and quality:

1. Development: Active development occurs in feature branches, with frequent commits and testing.
2. Pre-release: Alpha and beta releases are made available for testing and feedback.
3. Release Candidate: Candidates are prepared for final release, undergoing thorough testing.
4. Official Release: Stable versions are published, with version numbers incremented according to the changes.

Version Management
------------------

Each release is tagged with its version number and associated release notes, documenting the changes, improvements, and fixes included.

Compatibility
-------------

The package maintains compatibility within major versions, with backward-compatible updates in minor and patch releases. Users are encouraged to specify version constraints in their dependency management to ensure compatibility.

Updating to New Versions
------------------------

To update to the latest version, use your package manager (e.g., pip):

```bash
pip install --upgrade ftrack-api
```

For specific versions, specify the version number:

```bash
pip install ftrack-api==X.Y.Z
```

Support and Documentation
-------------------------

Detailed release notes and documentation are available for each version, providing guidance on new features, deprecated functionalities, and migration tips.

Contact and Feedback
--------------------

Users are encouraged to report issues and provide feedback to improve future releases. Contributions are welcome via the project's repository.
