Naive Bayes Module
==================

The :mod:`sklearn.naive_bayes` module provides implementations of various Naive Bayes algorithms, which are supervised learning methods based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) feature independence assumptions. These classifiers are particularly effective for high-dimensional data and are widely used in text classification, spam detection, and other applications.

Classes
-------

### _BaseNB
An abstract base class for naive Bayes estimators. It defines common methods and interface for all Naive Bayes classifiers, including:

- `_joint_log_likelihood(X)`: Computes the unnormalized posterior log probability of X.
- `_check_X(X)`: Checks and preprocesses input data.
- `predict_joint_log_proba(X)`: Returns joint log probability estimates for input samples.
- `predict(X)`: Predicts class labels for input samples.
- `predict_log_proba(X)`: Returns log-probability estimates for input samples.
- `predict_proba(X)`: Returns probability estimates for input samples.

### GaussianNB
The Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier assumes that features follow a Gaussian distribution within each class. It supports online updates to model parameters via the `partial_fit` method. 

Parameters
----------
- `priors` : array-like of shape (n_classes,), optional
  Prior probabilities of the classes. If not specified, priors are learned from the data.
- `var_smoothing` : float, default=1e-9
  Portion of the largest variance of all features added to variances for numerical stability.

Attributes
----------
- `class_count_` : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
  Number of training samples observed in each class.
- `class_prior_` : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
  Estimated prior probabilities of each class.
- `classes_` : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
  Class labels known to the classifier.
- `epsilon_` : float
  Absolute additive value to variances for stability.
- `n_features_in_` : int
  Number of features seen during fit.
- `feature_names_in_` : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,), optional
  Names of features seen during fit, available if input data has feature names.
- `var_` : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_features)
  Variance of each feature per class.
- `theta_` : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_features)
  Mean of each feature per class.
