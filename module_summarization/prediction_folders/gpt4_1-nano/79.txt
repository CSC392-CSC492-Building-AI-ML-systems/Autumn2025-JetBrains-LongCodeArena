classfiles
==========

This module provides functionality for reading and processing CLASS files, which are data files used in radio astronomy observations. The module is designed to load CLASS files into an `ObsBlock` object from the `pyspeckit.spectrum` package, facilitating analysis and visualization of spectral data.

Overview
--------

The module includes functions and constants for interpreting the structure of CLASS files, including file types, versions, record lengths, and header identifiers. It also offers utility functions such as `print_timing` for measuring execution time and `ensure_bytes` for handling string encoding differences between Python 2 and 3.

Key Components
--------------

### Constants and Dictionaries

- **filetype_dict**: Maps file type identifiers to descriptive strings, supporting multiple byte encodings.
- **fileversion_dict**: Maps file version identifiers to version labels.
- **record_lengths**: Defines record lengths for different file types.
- **header_id_numbers**: Maps header identifier numbers to descriptive section names.
- **header_id_lengths**: Specifies lengths of header sections, where applicable.

### Functions

- **print_timing(func)**: Decorator that measures and logs the execution time of the decorated function. Useful for profiling slow operations such as reading large CLASS files.
- **ensure_bytes(string)**: Ensures that input strings are in byte format, handling differences between Python 2 and 3.

Usage
-----

This module is intended to be imported and used as part of a larger data processing pipeline. It provides the necessary tools to parse CLASS files, interpret their headers, and load spectral data into `ObsBlock` objects for further analysis.

Notes
-----

- The module includes detailed comments and documentation strings for each function and constant.
- It handles various file formats and encodings, ensuring compatibility across different systems and CLASS file versions.
- The module is designed to be extendable for additional header sections or file types as needed.
