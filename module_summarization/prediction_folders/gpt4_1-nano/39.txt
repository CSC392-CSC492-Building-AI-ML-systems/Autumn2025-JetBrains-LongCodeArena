Model Usage
===========

Introduction
------------
The `Model` class serves as the foundational component for defining data models in the ORM framework. It provides mechanisms for field definitions, relationships, querying, and managing database interactions.

Defining a Model
----------------
Create a subclass of `Model` to define your data structure. Use class attributes to specify fields, relationships, and metadata.

Example:
```python
class User(Model):
    id = IntField(pk=True)
    name = CharField(max_length=50)
    email = CharField(unique=True)

    class Meta:
        table = "users"
        ordering = ["name"]
        unique_together = [("email",)]
```

Meta Information
----------------
The `Meta` inner class allows configuration of database table name, ordering, unique constraints, and other options. The framework extracts this information to manage database schema and queries.

Field Definitions
-----------------
Fields are defined as class attributes using field classes such as `IntField`, `CharField`, etc. These fields determine the data type and constraints.

Relationships
-------------
Relationships between models are established using relation fields:
- `ForeignKeyFieldInstance` for foreign keys
- `ManyToManyFieldInstance` for many-to-many relations
- `OneToOneFieldInstance` for one-to-one relations

Relationship Accessors
----------------------
The framework provides getter and setter methods for managing relationships:
- `_fk_getter`, `_fk_setter` for foreign keys
- `_rfk_getter` for reverse foreign keys
- `_ro2o_getter` for one-to-one relations
- `_m2m_getter` for many-to-many relations

Querying
--------
Models support querying through the `QuerySet` class, enabling filtering, ordering, and retrieving data.

Example:
```python
user = await User.filter(name="Alice").first()
```

Comments and Documentation
--------------------------
Comments can be added before attribute definitions using the `#:` syntax. These comments are extracted and can be used for documentation purposes.

Example:
```python
#: User's full name
name = CharField(max_length=50)
```

Meta Information Management
---------------------------
The `MetaInfo` class manages metadata for each model, including database table name, fields, indexes, ordering, and constraints. It ensures proper schema generation and query behavior.

Error Handling
--------------
The framework defines several exceptions for error handling:
- `ConfigurationError`
- `IncompleteInstanceError`
- `IntegrityError`
- `OperationalError`
- `TransactionManagementError`

These exceptions help manage and debug database operations effectively.

Conclusion
----------
The `Model` class and its associated components provide a comprehensive and flexible way to define, query, and manage data models within the ORM framework. Proper use of fields, relationships, and metadata ensures efficient database interactions and maintainable code.
