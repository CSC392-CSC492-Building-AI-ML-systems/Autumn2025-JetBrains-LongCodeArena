w_succ
=======

Description
-----------
The `w_succ` command lists segments that successfully reach a target state in a WESTPA simulation. It provides detailed information about recycled segments, including iteration number, segment ID, weight, and final progress coordinate values.

Usage
-----
```bash
w_succ [options]
```

Options
-------
- `-o`, `--output` OUTPUT_FILE
  : Specify the output file to store the results. If not provided, output is written to standard output.

Description of Output
---------------------
The output consists of a table with the following columns:
- **iteration**: The iteration number in the simulation.
- **seg_id**: The unique identifier of the segment.
- **weight**: The weight associated with the segment.
- **final progress coordinate values**: The final progress coordinate values for each recycled segment, formatted according to their data type.

Details
-------
The command processes data from the current and previous iterations of the simulation, identifying recycled segments (segments that have been recycled during the simulation). For each recycled segment, it retrieves the final progress coordinate values and outputs the information in a tabular format.

Example
-------
```bash
w_succ -o successful_segments.txt
```

This command will generate a list of successful (recycled) segments and save the output to `successful_segments.txt`.
