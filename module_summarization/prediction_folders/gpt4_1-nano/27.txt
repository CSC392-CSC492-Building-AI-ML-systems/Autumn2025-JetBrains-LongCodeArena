w_kinetics
===========

Description
-----------
The `w_kinetics` command is used to calculate state-to-state kinetics by tracing trajectories in molecular simulations. It provides an analysis of transition events between different macrostates, including fluxes, transition durations, and arrival counts.

Subcommands
-----------
- `trace`: Performs the primary analysis to compute averages and confidence intervals for path-tracing kinetics.

Usage
-----
The command is invoked as:
```
w_kinetics trace [options]
```

Output
------
The default output is saved in the file `kintrace.h5`, which contains the following datasets:

- `/conditional_fluxes` [iteration][state][state]
  - Floating-point values representing macrostate-to-macrostate fluxes. These are not normalized by the initial macrostate populations.
  
- `/conditional_arrivals` [iteration][stateA][stateB]
  - Integer counts of trajectories arriving at `stateB` in a given iteration, originating from `stateA`.
  
- `/total_fluxes` [iteration][state]
  - Floating-point total flux into each macrostate per iteration.
  
- `/arrivals` [iteration][state]
  - Integer counts of trajectories arriving at each state per iteration, regardless of origin.
  
- `/duration_count` [iteration]
  - Integer count of recorded transition event durations in each iteration.
  
- `/durations` [iteration][event duration]
  - Structured data containing:
    - `istate`: Integer, initial state of the transition.
    - `fstate`: Integer, final state of the transition.
    - `duration`: Floating-point, duration of the transition in units of tau.
    - `weight`: Floating-point, weight of the trajectory at the end of the transition (not normalized by initial state population).

Notes
-----
- The flux data in the output are not normalized to rates; further processing with `w_kinavg` is required to obtain rates, accounting for statistical fluctuations and correlations.
- The total flux into a state does not require normalization and can be used directly as a target flux.

Command-line Options
--------------------
Additional options and parameters can be specified to customize the analysis. For detailed options, refer to the `w_kinetics trace --help` command.
