Resources Module
================

This module provides classes and functions to manage and access resources such as schemas and other data files in a flexible and organized manner.

Classes
-------

DirectoryResourceMapping
------------------------
A resource mapping that reads resource content from a directory or directory tree.

Inherits from :class:`~asdf_standard.resource.DirectoryResourceMapping`.

ResourceMappingProxy
--------------------
A wrapper around a resource mapping that includes additional metadata about the package that provided the mapping.

Methods:
- `maybe_wrap(delegate)`: Wraps a delegate mapping into a ResourceMappingProxy if it is not already one.
- `__getitem__(uri)`: Retrieves the resource content for the given URI.
- `__len__()`: Returns the number of resources.
- `__iter__()`: Iterates over resource URIs.
- `delegate`: Property to access the underlying mapping.
- `package_name`: Property to get the name of the package providing the mapping.
- `package_version`: Property to get the version of the package.
- `class_name`: Property to get the fully qualified class name.
- `__eq__(other)`: Checks equality based on the delegate.
- `__hash__()`: Returns the hash based on the delegate.
- `__repr__()`: String representation including class, package, and size.

ResourceManager
---------------
A class that aggregates multiple resource mappings into a single interface, providing simplified access and error handling.

Methods:
- `__init__(resource_mappings)`: Initializes with an iterable of mappings.
- `__getitem__(uri)`: Retrieves resource content for a URI, raising KeyError if not found.
- `__len__()`: Returns the total number of resources.
- `__iter__()`: Iterates over all resource URIs.
- `__contains__(uri)`: Checks if a URI exists in the mappings.
- `__repr__()`: String representation indicating the number of resources.

JsonschemaResourceMapping
-------------------------
A resource mapping that fetches JSON schema metaschemas from the `jsonschema` package.

Methods:
- `__getitem__(uri)`: Retrieves the schema data for a given URI.
- `__len__()`: Returns the number of available schemas.
- `__iter__()`: Iterates over supported schema URIs.
- `__repr__()`: String representation of the mapping.

Functions
---------

get_json_schema_resource_mappings()
-----------------------------------
Returns a list containing an instance of `JsonschemaResourceMapping`, providing access to JSON schema metaschemas.

Constants
---------

_JSONSCHEMA_URI_TO_FILENAME
---------------------------
A dictionary mapping JSON Schema URIs to their corresponding filenames within the `jsonschema` package.

Usage
-----
These classes and functions facilitate the management of resources such as schemas and data files, allowing for directory-based, package-based, or combined resource access with metadata support. They are useful in applications requiring flexible resource handling, schema validation, or plugin-based architectures.
