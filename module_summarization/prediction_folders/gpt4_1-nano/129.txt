Table Data
==========

Overview
--------
The code provides classes and functions for handling table data verification, error reporting, and event notification within the context of the Astropy library. It includes mechanisms for verifying data integrity, managing nested error messages, and implementing observer patterns for object state changes.

Verification Classes and Options
-------------------------------
- VerifyError: Custom exception class for verification errors.
- VerifyWarning: Warning class used for verification-related warnings.
- VERIFY_OPTIONS: List of valid verification options, including "ignore", "warn", "exception", "fix", "silentfix", and combinations thereof.

Shared Verification Methods
---------------------------
- _Verify: A class containing shared methods for data verification.
  - run_option: Executes verification based on selected options, handling error reporting and fixing.
  - verify: Performs comprehensive verification of data, managing different reporting and fixing strategies, and raising warnings or errors as configured.

Error List Management
---------------------
- _ErrList: A class representing a nested list of verification errors.
  - __str__: Converts the nested error structure into a readable string.
  - iter_lines: Iterates through the nested errors, providing indented, hierarchical error messages.

Notification Mixin
------------------
- NotifierMixin: A mixin class enabling objects to register and notify listeners about changes.
  - _add_listener: Registers a listener with a weak reference.
  - _notify: Notifies all registered listeners of a change, calling their update methods if available.

Usage
-----
These classes facilitate robust data verification, error reporting, and event-driven updates within table data management in Astropy, ensuring data integrity and enabling responsive data handling workflows.
