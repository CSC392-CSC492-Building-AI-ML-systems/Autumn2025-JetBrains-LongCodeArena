========

This module provides functions and classes for estimating and inferring the survival function and cumulative incidence function in the context of right-censored data. It supports handling of multiple event types and optional weighting schemes, as well as optional covariate adjustment.

Functions
---------

.. function:: _calc_survfunc_right(time, status, weights=None, entry=None, compress=True, retall=True)

    Calculates the survival function and its standard error for a single group with right censoring.

    :param time: Array of event or censoring times.
    :param status: Array indicating event occurrence (>=1) or censoring (0).
    :param weights: Optional array of weights for each observation.
    :param entry: Optional array of entry times for left truncation.
    :param compress: If True, retains only times where an event occurred.
    :param retall: If True, returns additional intermediate results.
    :return: Tuple containing survival probabilities, standard errors, unique times, risk set sizes, and event counts.

.. function:: _calc_incidence_right(time, status, weights=None)

    Calculates the cumulative incidence function and its standard error for multiple causes of failure.

    :param time: Array of event or censoring times.
    :param status: Array indicating cause of event (1, 2, ...) or censoring (0).
    :param weights: Optional array of weights for each observation.
    :return: Tuple containing lists of cause-specific cumulative incidence functions, their standard errors, and unique times.

.. function:: _checkargs(time, status, entry, freq_weights, exog)

    Validates input arguments for consistency and correct dimensions.

    :param time: Array of times.
    :param status: Array of event indicators.
    :param entry: Array of entry times (optional).
    :param freq_weights: Array of frequency weights (optional).
    :param exog: Exogenous variables array (optional).
    :raises ValueError: If input dimensions are inconsistent or invalid.

Classes
-------

.. class:: CumIncidenceRight

    Provides estimation and inference for the cumulative incidence function in the presence of right censoring.

    Parameters
    ----------
    time : array_like
        Array of event or censoring times.
    status : array_like
        Array indicating event type (>=1) or censoring (0).
    title : str, optional
        Title used for plots and summaries.
    freq_weights : array_like, optional
        Array of frequency weights.
    exog : array_like, optional
        Covariate array to account for violations of independent censoring.
    bw_factor : float, optional
        Bandwidth multiplier for kernel-based estimation when exog is provided.
    dimred : bool, optional
        If True, applies proportional hazards regression models.

    Methods
    -------
    (Methods are not detailed here but include estimation, plotting, and inference routines for the cumulative incidence function.)

Notes
-----

- Only right censoring is supported.
- When frequency weights are provided, point estimates are returned without standard errors.
- The module supports multiple event types and optional covariate adjustment for complex survival analysis scenarios.
