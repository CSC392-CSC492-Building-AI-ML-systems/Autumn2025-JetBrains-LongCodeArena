Contributing to Qiskit Metal
=============================

Welcome to the Qiskit Metal contribution guide! We appreciate your interest in helping improve this open-source project. Below are some guidelines and resources to assist you in contributing effectively.

Code of Conduct
----------------
Please adhere to the [Qiskit Code of Conduct](https://qiskit.org/conduct) to ensure a welcoming and respectful environment for all contributors.

Getting Started
---------------
- Fork the repository and clone it locally.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Run existing tests and add new tests as needed.
- Submit a pull request with a descriptive title and detailed description.

Documentation
-------------
We encourage contributors to update or add documentation to help users understand and utilize Qiskit Metal features effectively.

Submodules and Modules
----------------------
Qiskit Metal contains various modules, including analyses and calculations. For example:

- `qiskit_metal.analyses`: Contains analysis tools such as `cpw_calculations` and `lumped_capacitive`.
- `em`: Includes electromagnetic calculations like `cpw_calculations`.
- `quantization`: Provides tools such as `lumped_capacitive`.

Calculations and Tools
----------------------
Qiskit Metal offers several computational tools, including:

### CPW Parameter Calculations
These functions assist in designing and analyzing coplanar waveguides (CPWs):

- `guided_wavelength(freq, line_width, line_gap, substrate_thickness, film_thickness, dielectric_constant=11.45)`

  Calculates the guided wavelength of a planar CPW transmission line based on input parameters such as frequency, line dimensions, substrate properties, and dielectric constant. Returns the wavelength, effective dielectric constant, and filling factor.

- `lumped_cpw(freq, line_width, line_gap, substrate_thickness, film_thickness, dielectric_constant=11.45, loss_tangent=1e-5, london_penetration_depth=30e-9)`

  Provides the lumped element equivalent of a CPW transmission line, including kinetic inductance, geometric inductance, capacitance, admittance, characteristic impedance, and external inductance.

Usage
-----
These tools are intended for use by researchers and engineers designing superconducting circuits and quantum devices. Proper understanding of the physical parameters and assumptions is recommended for accurate application.

Contributing
------------
We welcome contributions from the community. Please follow the guidelines outlined in the [contributing documentation](https://qiskit.org/contribute) to submit your improvements.
