Camera Geometry and Data Handling
===================================

Overview
--------
This section provides information on working with images and data cubes associated with Cherenkov Cameras. It covers the fundamental concepts and tools necessary for handling camera data, including geometry, readout, and image processing.

Camera Geometry
---------------
The camera geometry defines the spatial arrangement of pixels in a Cherenkov Camera. It is essential for interpreting the raw data collected by the camera and for reconstructing the observed Cherenkov images.

Key Classes and Functions:
- `CameraGeometry`: Represents the pixel layout of the camera, including pixel positions, shapes, and sizes.
- `CameraReadout`: Describes the readout configuration, such as the number of samples and sampling rate.
- `CameraDescription`: Combines geometry and readout information, providing a comprehensive description of the camera.

Working with Images
-------------------
Images captured by Cherenkov Cameras are typically stored as 2D arrays (data cubes) where each pixel value corresponds to the detected Cherenkov light intensity.

Processing Steps:
1. Access the raw image data from data files or data cubes.
2. Use the camera geometry to interpret pixel positions and shapes.
3. Apply calibration and cleaning algorithms to enhance the signal.
4. Extract features such as Hillas parameters for further analysis.

Data Cubes
----------
Data cubes are multi-dimensional arrays that may include multiple images or time samples per pixel. They are used for detailed analysis, such as waveform extraction and temporal studies.

Handling Data Cubes:
- Load data cubes from files using appropriate I/O routines.
- Map data to camera geometry for visualization and analysis.
- Perform operations like summing over time samples or applying filters.

Visualization
-------------
Visualizing images and data cubes involves plotting pixel intensities with respect to their spatial arrangement. Tools like `matplotlib` can be used to display 2D images, while specialized libraries may be employed for 3D data.

Summary
-------
Working with Cherenkov Camera images and data cubes requires understanding the camera geometry, proper data handling, and visualization techniques. The provided classes and functions facilitate these tasks, enabling effective analysis of Cherenkov telescope data.
