Generate Description for imputation.rst
========================================

Overview
--------
This module provides tools for handling missing data through Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). It enables users to generate multiple complete datasets by iteratively imputing missing values using specified models, facilitating robust statistical analysis and inference.

Key Features
------------
- Implements the MICE algorithm with support for various imputation models, primarily linear regression models.
- Supports different perturbation methods such as Gaussian and bootstrap to incorporate uncertainty in parameter estimates.
- Provides the `MICEData` class for managing datasets and performing imputations, including visualization and history tracking.
- Offers the `MICE` class to perform multiple imputations, fit analysis models, and combine results for inference.
- Allows customization of imputation models via formulas and supports predictive mean matching for imputations.
- Facilitates both single imputation datasets and multiple imputation workflows for comprehensive missing data analysis.

Classes
-------
- `MICEData`: Wraps a pandas DataFrame to handle missing data, perform imputations, and visualize missing data patterns.
- `MICE`: Manages the multiple imputation process, fits analysis models, and aggregates results.
- `PatsyFormula`: A simple wrapper for specifying regression formulas used in imputation models.

Usage
-----
Users can initialize a `MICEData` object with their dataset, configure imputation models for variables with missing data, and run iterative imputations. For analysis purposes, a `MICE` object can be created with the data and an analysis model, enabling multiple imputation, model fitting, and result summarization.
