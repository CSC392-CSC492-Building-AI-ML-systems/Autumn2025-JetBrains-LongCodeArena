Generate Description for miscmodels.rst
========================================

This module provides an implementation of a Linear Model with Student-t distributed errors, designed for robust statistical modeling in the presence of outliers and heavy-tailed data. The core class, `TLinearModel`, extends the `GenericLikelihoodModel` from statsmodels to facilitate maximum likelihood estimation of linear regression models where the error terms follow a Student-t distribution. This approach offers more resilient parameter estimates compared to traditional Gaussian-based models, especially when data exhibit deviations from normality.

Key Features:
- Flexible degrees of freedom parameter (`df`) that can be fixed or estimated from the data.
- Robust estimation of regression coefficients, scale, and degrees of freedom.
- Customizable starting values based on ordinary least squares (OLS) residuals and kurtosis.
- Log-likelihood computation tailored for Student-t errors, supporting robust inference.
- Support for fixed or estimated degrees of freedom, enabling tailored modeling strategies.

Additional classes include `TArma`, which extends univariate ARMA models to incorporate Student-t distributed errors, providing robust time series analysis capabilities. The `TArma` class inherits from `Arma` and overrides the likelihood functions to accommodate the Student-t distribution, allowing for more accurate modeling of heavy-tailed time series data.

This module is suitable for researchers and practitioners seeking robust linear and time series models that can handle outliers and heavy-tailed residuals effectively. It is part of the larger statsmodels framework, leveraging its infrastructure for likelihood-based estimation and statistical inference.
