filenode - Simulating a Filesystem with PyTables
===============================================

Overview
--------
The `filenode` module provides a simulated filesystem interface within PyTables databases. It allows users to create, open, and manipulate file-like objects stored as nodes in HDF5 files, enabling binary I/O operations directly on database nodes. This module is particularly useful for applications requiring file-like access to data stored inside a PyTables database, facilitating seamless integration of filesystem semantics with database storage.

Key Features
------------
- Create new file nodes with `new_node()`
- Open existing nodes with `open_node()`
- Read and write binary data as if interacting with regular files
- Support for appending data, reading, seeking, and truncating
- Compatibility with Python's `io` module interfaces
- Versioning support for node attributes

Classes
-------
### RawPyTablesIO
A core class providing raw binary I/O operations on a PyTables node.

#### Initialization
```python
RawPyTablesIO(node, mode=None)
```
- `node`: The PyTables node representing the file.
- `mode`: Mode string similar to Python's file modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a+'`, etc.). Defaults to the node's mode.

#### Properties
- `mode`: Returns the mode in which the node was opened.

#### Methods
- `tell()`: Returns the current stream position.
- `seek(pos, whence=0)`: Changes the stream position.
- `seekable()`: Indicates support for random access.
- `fileno()`: Returns the underlying file descriptor if available.
- `close()`: Closes the IO object.
- `flush()`: Flushes write buffers.
- `truncate(pos=None)`: Truncates the node to a specified size.
- `readinto(b)`: Reads bytes into a pre-allocated, writable bytes-like object.
- `readline(limit=-1)`: Reads a line from the stream.
- `write(b)`: Writes bytes to the node (not shown in the excerpt but typically implemented).

Usage
-----
The `filenode` module enables applications to treat nodes within a PyTables database as if they were regular files, supporting standard file operations such as reading, writing, seeking, and truncating. This abstraction simplifies data manipulation workflows, especially when working with large datasets stored in HDF5 format.

See the `filenode_usersguide` reference for detailed instructions and best practices on using the module effectively.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
This module is compatible with node attribute version 1 and 2, ensuring flexibility across different data schemas within PyTables.

Note
----
Only binary I/O is supported, and write operations are limited to appending data or growing the node size. Data rewriting or deletion within nodes is not supported.
