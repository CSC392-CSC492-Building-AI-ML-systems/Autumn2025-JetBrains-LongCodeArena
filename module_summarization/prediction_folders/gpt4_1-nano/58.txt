Generate Description for Optimization Module
=============================================

Overview
--------
This module provides a set of general-purpose functions and classes designed for model fitting and optimization tasks. The primary goal is to create reusable components that are decoupled from specific model implementations, such as LikelihoodModel, enabling their application across various modeling scenarios.

Key Components
--------------
- `_check_method(method, methods)`: Utility function to validate the chosen optimization method against a list of supported methods. Raises a ValueError if an unsupported method is specified.

- `Optimizer` Class: 
  - `_fit()`: Core method that performs optimization to fit a model based on an objective function. It supports multiple optimization algorithms, including Newton-Raphson, Nelder-Mead, BFGS, Powell, Conjugate Gradient, Newton-CG, and Basin-Hopping. 
  - The method accepts initial parameters, optimization method, maximum iterations, and various solver-specific options. It also provides options for detailed output, callback functions during iterations, and returning all intermediate solutions.

Usage
-----
The `_fit()` method is designed to be flexible, allowing users to specify the optimization strategy and parameters suited to their specific problem. It returns the optimal parameters, optional detailed solver output, and the settings used for the optimization process.

Notes
-----
- The module supports a variety of optimization methods, each with customizable options such as tolerances, maximum function evaluations, and step sizes.
- The 'basinhopping' solver operates differently, ignoring certain explicit arguments like `maxiter` and `retall`.
- The design emphasizes extensibility and reusability, making it suitable for a wide range of model fitting applications beyond specific likelihood models.

This module serves as a foundational component for implementing robust and flexible optimization routines in statistical modeling and data analysis workflows.
