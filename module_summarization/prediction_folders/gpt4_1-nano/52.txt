Generate
========
The Generate module provides tools and classes for implementing the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimation techniques, particularly in the context of instrumental variables (IV) regression. It includes the IV2SLS class for performing IV estimation, along with associated result classes for analyzing and interpreting the estimation outcomes.

This module addresses key issues such as parameter initialization, handling cases where the optimal weighting matrix cannot be computed numerically, and integrating GMM with underlying models like linear regressions or panel data models. It also discusses potential enhancements, including reusing regression methods (predict, fitted values, error calculation) within GMM, and considerations for degrees of freedom and test statistics like J-test and Hausman test.

Designed to be flexible and extensible, the module aims to facilitate robust estimation and inference in econometric models involving endogenous regressors and instrumental variables, while providing a foundation for further development and customization.
