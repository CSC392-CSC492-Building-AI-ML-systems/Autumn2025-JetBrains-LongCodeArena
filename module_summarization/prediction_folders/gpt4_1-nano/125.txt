FITS Headers
============

Introduction
------------
The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is a digital file format widely used in astronomy for storing, transmitting, and processing scientific data. A FITS file consists of a header and data units, where the header contains metadata describing the data contained in the file.

FITS Header Structure
---------------------
A FITS header is composed of a sequence of 2880-byte blocks, each containing ASCII card images. Each card image is a 80-character string that encodes a keyword, value, and optional comment. The header ends with an 'END' card, and any remaining space in the block is filled with blank cards.

Header Cards
------------
Each header card follows a standard format:
- Keyword: An 8-character identifier (e.g., 'NAXIS', 'BITPIX')
- Value: The data associated with the keyword, formatted according to its type
- Comment: An optional descriptive comment, separated from the value by a slash ('/')

Common Keywords
---------------
- SIMPLE: Indicates if the file conforms to the FITS standard (value: 'T' or 'F')
- BITPIX: Number of bits per data value
- NAXIS: Number of data axes
- NAXISn: Length of the nth data axis
- EXTEND: Indicates if the file may contain extensions
- DATE: Date of file creation
- OBJECT: Name of the observed object
- TELESCOP: Name of the telescope used
- INSTRUME: Instrument used for observation

Accessing and Modifying Headers
-------------------------------
Headers can be read and modified programmatically using specialized libraries such as Astropy. These libraries provide classes and methods to access header cards, retrieve values, and update metadata while maintaining compliance with FITS standards.

Validation and Verification
---------------------------
Tools and methods are available to verify the integrity and correctness of FITS headers. Verification can include checking for the presence of required keywords, correct data types, and adherence to formatting standards. The verification process can be configured to ignore, warn, or raise exceptions on issues, and to attempt automatic fixes where possible.

Best Practices
--------------
- Always include essential keywords such as SIMPLE, BITPIX, NAXIS, and NAXISn
- Use standardized keywords for compatibility and interoperability
- Maintain consistency in data types and units
- Validate headers before processing to ensure data integrity
- Document custom keywords and conventions used in your FITS files
