hyperexpand
===========

Overview
--------

The `hyperexpand` module provides functionality to expand hypergeometric and Meijer G functions into expressions involving named special functions. This process leverages a collection of lookup tables, properties, and identities of hypergeometric functions to facilitate their transformation into more manageable forms.

Purpose
-------

The primary goal of this module is to automate the expansion of hypergeometric functions, enabling easier analysis, simplification, and numerical evaluation. It is especially useful in symbolic computation contexts where expressing functions in terms of well-understood special functions is advantageous.

Key Features
------------

- Expansion of hypergeometric functions into known special functions.
- Utilizes lookup tables and functional identities for transformations.
- Supports Meijer G functions and their properties.
- Implements algorithms based on scholarly research, notably Roach's work on Meijer G function representations.
- Handles various shift operators and order reduction techniques to simplify expressions.
- Provides routines for matching and instantiating formulas to facilitate transformations.

Mathematical Foundations
------------------------

The expansion algorithms are grounded in advanced mathematical theories and identities related to hypergeometric functions and Meijer G functions. These include:

- Parameter shifting and order reduction techniques.
- Symmetry properties of parameters.
- Use of shift operators (A_J, B_J, C_J, D_J) and their inverses.
- Reduction formulas when parameters differ by integers.
- Theoretical basis from Roach's 1997 paper on Meijer G function representations.

Implementation Details
----------------------

The module imports a variety of core, function, and printing utilities to support its operations. It defines internal functions such as `_mod1` for modular arithmetic handling, and `add_formulae` to populate the knowledge base with known formulas and identities.

The core data structure is a collection of formulas (`FormulaCollection`) that encode the relationships and transformations of hypergeometric functions. These formulas are used to systematically expand functions into their special function representations.

Usage
-----

The module is intended to be used as part of a larger symbolic computation workflow, particularly within the SymPy ecosystem. Users can invoke its functions to expand hypergeometric functions in symbolic expressions, aiding in analytical work or preparing expressions for numerical evaluation.

Notes
-----

- The module includes extensive comments and documentation within the code to facilitate understanding and future development.
- It supports symbolic manipulation of a wide range of hypergeometric functions, including those with parameters that differ by integers or are subject to parameter shifts.
- The implementation emphasizes modularity and extensibility, allowing for the addition of new formulas and identities as needed.
