Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA and QDA)
==========================================================

Overview
--------
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) are powerful classification techniques used in statistical pattern recognition and machine learning. Both methods are based on modeling the distribution of the features for each class and then applying Bayes' theorem to perform classification.

Key Concepts
------------
- **Discriminant Analysis**: A statistical technique used to classify observations into predefined classes based on their features.
- **Assumptions**:
  - LDA assumes that the different classes share the same covariance matrix, leading to linear decision boundaries.
  - QDA allows each class to have its own covariance matrix, resulting in quadratic decision boundaries.
- **Distribution**: Both methods assume that the features within each class follow a multivariate normal distribution.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
----------------------------------
LDA seeks to find a linear combination of features that best separates the classes. It models the distribution of each class with a multivariate normal distribution, sharing a common covariance matrix across classes.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Assumes \(X | Y = y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_y, \Sigma)\), where \(\mu_y\) is the mean vector for class \(y\), and \(\Sigma\) is the shared covariance matrix.
- The decision rule is based on the linear discriminant function:
  
  \[
  \delta_y(x) = x^T \Sigma^{-1} \mu_y - \frac{1}{2} \mu_y^T \Sigma^{-1} \mu_y + \log \pi_y
  \]
  
  where \(\pi_y\) is the prior probability of class \(y\).

**Advantages**:
- Computationally efficient.
- Performs well when class distributions are approximately normal and share covariance.

**Limitations**:
- Assumes equal covariance matrices across classes.
- Less flexible for complex class boundaries.

Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
-------------------------------------
QDA extends LDA by allowing each class to have its own covariance matrix, leading to quadratic decision boundaries.

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Assumes \(X | Y = y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_y, \Sigma_y)\), with class-specific covariance matrices.
- The decision rule involves quadratic discriminant functions:

  \[
  \delta_y(x) = -\frac{1}{2} \log |\Sigma_y| - \frac{1}{2} (x - \mu_y)^T \Sigma_y^{-1} (x - \mu_y) + \log \pi_y
  \]

**Advantages**:
- More flexible, capable of modeling complex class boundaries.
- Suitable when class covariances differ significantly.

**Limitations**:
- Requires estimating more parameters, which can be problematic with small datasets.
- Computationally more intensive than LDA.

Implementation in scikit-learn
------------------------------
scikit-learn provides implementations of both LDA and QDA through the `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis` and `QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis` classes, respectively. These classes inherit from the base estimators and integrate seamlessly with scikit-learn's model selection and evaluation tools.

Usage Example
-------------
```python
from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis

# Initialize the classifiers
lda = LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()
qda = QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis()

# Fit the models
lda.fit(X_train, y_train)
qda.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred_lda = lda.predict(X_test)
y_pred_qda = qda.predict(X_test)
```

Summary
-------
LDA and QDA are valuable tools for classification tasks where the assumptions about the data distribution are reasonably met. LDA offers simplicity and efficiency, while QDA provides greater flexibility at the cost of increased complexity. Proper understanding of the data characteristics is essential to choose the appropriate method.
