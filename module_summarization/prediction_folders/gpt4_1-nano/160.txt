Compatibility Policy
====================

Our software is designed to maintain a high level of compatibility across various platforms, operating systems, and Python versions. We are committed to providing a consistent and reliable experience for all users, regardless of their environment.

Platform Compatibility
----------------------
- The code supports multiple operating systems including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Special considerations are made for platform-specific features and compiler flags, such as handling Cygwin environments.
- We ensure that the build process adapts to different system architectures and compilers.

Python Compatibility
--------------------
- The project is compatible with Python versions supported by the underlying dependencies.
- We utilize Cython to generate extension modules that work seamlessly across supported Python versions.
- Stub files (.pxd, .pyi) are included to facilitate type checking and IDE support across different Python environments.

Dependency Compatibility
------------------------
- The build process manages dependencies such as NumPy and core libraries to ensure compatibility.
- External C libraries are integrated carefully, with platform-specific flags and configurations to ensure smooth compilation and linking.

Backward Compatibility
----------------------
- We strive to maintain backward compatibility with previous versions of the library.
- Changes that could break compatibility are carefully considered and documented.
- Deprecated features are supported for a transition period before removal.

Future Compatibility
--------------------
- The codebase is designed with future updates in mind, allowing for easier adaptation to new Python versions and platforms.
- We monitor developments in the Python ecosystem and relevant dependencies to ensure ongoing compatibility.

Contact and Support
-------------------
- For questions or issues related to compatibility, please contact our support team or consult the project's issue tracker.
- We welcome community contributions that improve compatibility and platform support.

This policy aims to ensure that our software remains robust, reliable, and easy to integrate across diverse environments.
