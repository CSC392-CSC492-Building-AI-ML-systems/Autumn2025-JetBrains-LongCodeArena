Querying
========

The ftrack API provides a comprehensive querying system to interact with and retrieve data from an ftrack server. This system is designed to be flexible and efficient, supporting various query types and filters to access the desired entities and information.

Query Classes
-------------

ftrack_api.query module contains classes that facilitate building and executing queries against the server. These classes allow you to specify criteria, filters, and projections to tailor the data retrieval process.

Key Query Features
------------------

- Entity Retrieval: Fetch specific entities such as tasks, shots, assets, etc., by their identifiers or attributes.
- Filtering: Apply filters to narrow down results based on attribute values, relationships, or custom criteria.
- Sorting: Order results based on one or more attributes.
- Pagination: Retrieve data in chunks to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Projection: Select specific fields or attributes to include in the results, reducing data transfer and processing overhead.

Using the Query System
-----------------------

To perform a query, instantiate the relevant query class from the ftrack_api.query module, configure it with the desired parameters, and execute it through a session object.

Example:
```python
import ftrack_api

session = ftrack_api.Session(server_url='https://your.ftrack.server')
query = ftrack_api.query.FilteredQuery('Asset', filters=[
    ('name', 'contains', 'model'),
    ('type', 'is', '3D')
])
assets = session.query(query)
for asset in assets:
    print(asset)
```

This example demonstrates creating a filtered query to retrieve assets with names containing "model" and of type "3D".

Advanced Querying
-----------------

The querying system supports complex queries involving multiple filters, logical operators, and nested conditions. It also integrates seamlessly with the entity system, allowing for intuitive navigation and data access.

For detailed information on available query classes, methods, and usage patterns, refer to the ftrack_api.query module documentation and the API reference.

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

Efficient querying is essential for performance, especially with large datasets. Use filtering and projection to limit the amount of data transferred and processed. Leverage pagination for large result sets and consider caching strategies where appropriate.
