Header Interface Transition Guide
=================================

Introduction
------------
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Header Interface Transition, outlining the key concepts, classes, and mechanisms involved in the transition process. It is intended for developers and users who need to understand the structure, functionality, and usage of the header interface within the system.

Verification Framework
----------------------
The verification framework is designed to ensure the integrity and correctness of header data. It includes classes and methods to perform various verification checks, handle errors and warnings, and manage verification options.

Key Classes and Functions
-------------------------
- VerifyError: Custom exception class for verification errors.
- VerifyWarning: Warning class for verification-related warnings.
- _Verify: Core class providing shared verification methods, including run_option() and verify().
- _ErrList: List class for managing nested verification error messages with hierarchical structure.

Verification Options
--------------------
The verification process supports multiple options to control behavior:
- ignore: Skip verification.
- warn: Issue warnings on verification issues.
- exception: Raise exceptions on verification issues.
- fix: Attempt to automatically fix issues.
- silentfix: Fix issues silently without reporting.
- Combinations such as fix+warn, silentfix+ignore, etc., to customize verification handling.

Usage
-----
The verification system allows users to run checks with specified options, handle fixable and unfixable errors, and control reporting behavior. It supports detailed error reporting with hierarchical error lists, facilitating debugging and data integrity assurance.

Notifier Mixin
--------------
The NotifierMixin class provides a mechanism for objects to register listeners and notify them of changes. It supports weak references to prevent memory leaks and enables decoupled communication between components.

Summary
-------
This transition guide summarizes the core components and mechanisms involved in the header interface transition, emphasizing verification processes, error handling, and event notification. Proper understanding of these elements is essential for maintaining data integrity and system robustness during the transition process.
