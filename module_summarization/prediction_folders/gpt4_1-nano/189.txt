Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)
===============================
Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a powerful supervised learning method that combines ridge regression with the kernel trick. It allows modeling complex, non-linear relationships by implicitly mapping data into a high-dimensional feature space using kernels.

Overview
--------
KRR learns a linear function in the feature space induced by a specified kernel, which corresponds to a non-linear function in the original input space. Unlike support vector regression (SVR), KRR uses squared error loss and can be solved in closed form, making it computationally efficient for medium-sized datasets. However, the resulting model is non-sparse, which may lead to slower predictions compared to sparse models like SVR.

This estimator supports multi-target regression, enabling simultaneous prediction of multiple outputs.

Parameters
----------
- **alpha** : float or array-like of shape (n_targets,)
    Regularization strength; must be positive. Larger values increase regularization, reducing model variance.
- **kernel** : str or callable, default="linear"
    Kernel function used internally. It can be a string referring to a predefined kernel or a callable function. If "precomputed", the input is assumed to be a precomputed kernel matrix.
- **gamma** : float, default=None
    Kernel coefficient for RBF, Laplacian, Polynomial, Exponential Chi-squared, and Sigmoid kernels.
- **degree** : int, default=3
    Degree of the polynomial kernel.
- **coef0** : float, default=1
    Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
- **kernel_params** : dict, default=None
    Additional parameters for the kernel function.

Attributes
----------
- **dual_coef_** : ndarray of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_targets)
    Coefficients in the kernel space representing the learned model.
- **X_fit_** : ndarray or sparse matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features)
    Training data used for fitting. If the kernel is "precomputed", this is the training kernel matrix.
- **n_features_in_** : int
    Number of features seen during fitting.
- **feature_names_in_** : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`)
    Names of features seen during fitting, available if input data has feature names.

Examples
--------
```python
from sklearn.kernel_ridge import KernelRidge
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
n_samples, n_features = 10, 5
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
y = rng.randn(n_samples)
X = rng.randn(n_samples, n_features)

# Initialize and fit the model
krr = KernelRidge(alpha=1.0)
krr.fit(X, y)

# Model summary
print(krr)
```
