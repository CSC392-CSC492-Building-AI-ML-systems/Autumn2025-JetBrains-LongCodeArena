Storage Driver Documentation
============================

Overview
--------
The Storage driver is a core component responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of data in various formats, including NetCDF and others. It provides an interface for creating, accessing, and manipulating storage variables on disk, abstracting the underlying file format and storage details.

Key Classes
-----------
- StorageInterfaceDirVar: A versatile class that represents storage variables and directories on disk. It allows dynamic creation and access of variables and folders by using attribute access. This class handles reading, writing, and appending data to storage variables, ensuring data is stored efficiently and consistently.

Features
--------
- Dynamic Variable and Directory Handling: Variables and directories are created on-demand when accessed as properties, enabling flexible data organization.
- Data Management: Supports writing data (overwrite), appending data to variables with dynamic size, and reading stored data back into Python objects.
- Metadata Handling: Maintains metadata buffers and ensures metadata is updated appropriately during data modifications.
- Compatibility: Designed to work seamlessly with different storage formats, primarily NetCDF, via the associated storage driver.

Usage
-----
### Writing Data
To store data in a variable, use the `write()` method:
```python
my_storage_var.write(data)
```
This method creates the variable if it does not exist and writes the data to disk.

### Appending Data
To append data to a variable with a dynamic size, use the `append()` method:
```python
my_storage_var.append(data)
```
This adds data to the end of the variable, expanding its size as needed.

### Reading Data
To retrieve data from a variable, use the `read()` method:
```python
data = my_storage_var.read()
```
This reads the stored data, converting it back into a Python object.

Implementation Details
----------------------
- The driver interacts with storage variables through methods like `get_storage_variable()` and `create_storage_variable()`.
- It manages variable existence and type consistency, creating variables as needed.
- Error handling is incorporated to manage missing variables or access issues.
- The driver is designed to be extendable to support additional storage formats and custom behaviors.

Note
----
The Storage driver is intended to be used internally within higher-level storage management classes. It is not meant to be instantiated directly by users but rather through the StorageInterface abstraction layer.

This documentation provides an overview of the Storage driver’s capabilities and usage patterns to facilitate efficient data management in scientific and data-intensive applications.
