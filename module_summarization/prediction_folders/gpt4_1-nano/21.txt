w_eddist
=========
Calculate time-resolved transition-event duration distribution from kinetics results.

Description
-----------
The `w_eddist` command analyzes kinetics data to produce histograms of transition-event durations over time. It processes results from the `w_kinetics trace` command, extracting relevant datasets and constructing histograms with configurable binning options.

Source Data
-----------
The input data is obtained from the output of `w_kinetics trace`. This data includes information about transition events and their durations across different iterations.

Histogram Binning
-----------------
By default, histograms are created with 100 bins per dimension. Users can customize binning through the `-b/--bins` option with various argument types:
- Single integer N: uses N uniformly spaced bins in each dimension.
- Sequence of integers N1,N2,...: specifies the number of bins per dimension.
- List of lists [[B11, B12, ...], [B21, B22, ...], ...]: defines explicit bin boundaries for each dimension, allowing non-uniform binning. These boundaries are evaluated with Python's `eval`, with `np` available.

Note: Explicit bin boundaries prevent expensive min/max scans of large datasets.

Output Format
-------------
The output is stored in an HDF5 file (default: `pdist.h5`) containing:
- `histograms`: Normalized histograms with the first axis representing iterations.
- `/binbounds_0`, `/binbounds_1`, ...: Bin boundaries for each dimension.
- `/midpoints_0`, `/midpoints_1`, ...: Bin midpoints for each dimension.
- `n_iter`: Array of iteration numbers corresponding to the histograms.

Subsequent Processing
---------------------
The generated output can be visualized using the `plothist` program, which supports plotting histograms and further analysis.

Parallelization
---------------
`w_eddist` supports parallel processing for data reading and histogram binning, which is enabled by default. For simpler or smaller datasets, serial processing (`--serial`) may be more efficient.

Command-line Options
--------------------
Various options are available to customize the behavior of `w_eddist`, including input/output files, binning parameters, and processing modes. Refer to the command's help message for detailed options and usage instructions.
