# Connect to Remote Data

The `read_bytes` function provided in this module allows you to read data from remote locations by providing a path or paths to the data. The function returns delayed objects that can read from the specified paths. The paths can be filenames or globstrings, and they can be preceded by protocols like `s3://` or `hdfs://` if the necessary libraries are installed.

You can specify a delimiter to cleanly break the data into blocks, ensuring that block boundaries start and end on the delimiter. Other parameters include `not_zero` to force seeking the start-of-file delimiter, `blocksize` to set the chunk size in bytes, `compression` to specify the compression type, `sample` to determine whether to return a header sample, and `include_path` to include the path with the bytes representing a particular file.

The function also provides examples of how to use it with different parameters and returns the sample header, a list of delayed objects representing blocks of bytes from each file, and optionally a list of paths to the files if `include_path` is set to `True`.

Additionally, the module includes a `zip_compress` function that writes data into a zipfile and returns the bytes. This can be useful for compressing data before transferring it to remote locations.
