# How Mitogen Works

Mitogen is a Python library that implements most of its package functionality separately from non-essential code. This separation helps reduce the size of the library, making it more efficient. The core functionality of Mitogen is designed to be sent to every new slave context as part of the bootstrap implementation.

Mitogen utilizes various modules and libraries to achieve its functionality. Some of the key components include:

- `binascii`: Provides tools for converting between binary and ASCII representations.
- `collections`: Implements specialized container datatypes.
- `encodings`: Includes modules for handling different character encodings such as Latin-1 and UTF-8.
- `errno`: Defines standard error codes.
- `fcntl`: Provides functions for working with file descriptors.
- `itertools`: Offers tools for creating and working with iterators.
- `logging`: Enables logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring.
- `os`: Provides operating system interfaces.
- `pickle`: Implements binary protocols for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
- `socket`: Supports networking operations.
- `struct`: Allows for packing and unpacking binary data.
- `sys`: Provides access to Python interpreter variables and functions.
- `threading`: Offers threading support for concurrent execution.
- `time`: Provides time-related functions.
- `traceback`: Enables extraction of stack traces.
- `warnings`: Allows for issuing warning messages.
- `weakref`: Implements weak references to objects.
- `zlib`: Provides compression and decompression tools.

Mitogen also includes various constants and special values, such as `GET_MODULE`, `CALL_FUNCTION`, `FORWARD_LOG`, `IS_DEAD`, and more, which are used for message passing and routing within the Mitogen framework.

The library handles compatibility issues across different Python versions, ensuring that it can run smoothly on both Python 2 and Python 3 environments. Mitogen also includes workarounds for specific platform quirks, such as detecting if it is running within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Overall, Mitogen is designed to provide efficient and reliable communication channels between different Python processes, enabling seamless interaction and data exchange in a distributed computing environment.
