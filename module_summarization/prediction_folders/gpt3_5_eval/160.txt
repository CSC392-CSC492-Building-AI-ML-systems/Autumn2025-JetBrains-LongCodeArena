Compatibility Policy
=====================

The compatibility policy for the `numpy.random` module ensures that changes and updates are made in a manner that maintains backward compatibility whenever possible. This policy is designed to minimize disruptions for users who rely on the functionality provided by `numpy.random`.

**Backward Compatibility:** Changes to the `numpy.random` module will strive to maintain backward compatibility with previous versions whenever feasible. This includes preserving existing function signatures, behaviors, and outputs to the extent possible.

**Deprecation:** When a change is necessary that may impact existing code, deprecated features will be clearly marked and documented. Deprecated features will continue to function as expected for a reasonable period before being removed in a future release.

**Versioning:** Changes that may introduce compatibility issues will be clearly communicated through version updates following semantic versioning principles. Major version updates will indicate significant changes that may require modifications to user code.

**Migration Path:** Documentation will provide guidance on migrating from deprecated features to recommended alternatives. This guidance will aim to assist users in updating their code smoothly when transitioning to newer versions of `numpy.random`.

**Community Feedback:** Feedback from the community regarding compatibility issues will be actively monitored and considered in the development process. User input will help identify potential compatibility concerns and inform decisions on how best to address them.

By adhering to this compatibility policy, the `numpy.random` module aims to provide a stable and reliable environment for users to leverage its functionality while also allowing for necessary improvements and enhancements over time.
