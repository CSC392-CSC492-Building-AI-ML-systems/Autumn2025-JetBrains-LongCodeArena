To use QuerySet to build your queries, you can follow these steps:

1. **Prefetch Related Fields**: Use the `prefetch_related` method to prefetch related fields for efficient querying.

2. **Annotate Results**: Add annotations to your query results using the `annotate` method.

3. **Select Specific Fields**: Use the `only` method to select specific fields for retrieval.

4. **Retrieve Values List**: Use the `values_list` method to retrieve a list of specific field values.

5. **Retrieve Values**: Use the `values` method to retrieve specific values based on arguments and keyword arguments.

6. **Resolve Filters**: Build common filters for your QuerySet by resolving Q expressions, annotations, and custom filters.

7. **Resolve Ordering**: Apply standard ordering to your QuerySet by resolving orderings based on model fields and annotations.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively use QuerySet to construct and execute queries in your application.
