# Tensor Attributes

Tensor Attributes in the OneFlow Dialect represent various properties and metadata associated with tensors. These attributes provide essential information about the tensors used in the OneFlow framework. Some of the key Tensor Attributes include:

- Shape: Describes the dimensions of the tensor, such as the number of rows and columns.
- Data Type: Specifies the type of data stored in the tensor, such as integer, float, or boolean.
- Device Placement: Indicates the device on which the tensor is located, such as CPU or GPU.
- Memory Layout: Defines how the data is organized in memory, such as row-major or column-major.
- Quantization Parameters: Stores information related to quantization, if applicable.
- Gradient Function: Specifies the function used to compute gradients for the tensor during backpropagation.

These attributes play a crucial role in defining the behavior and characteristics of tensors within the OneFlow Dialect, enabling efficient computation and optimization strategies. By leveraging Tensor Attributes, developers can effectively manage and manipulate tensors to achieve desired outcomes in their machine learning workflows.
