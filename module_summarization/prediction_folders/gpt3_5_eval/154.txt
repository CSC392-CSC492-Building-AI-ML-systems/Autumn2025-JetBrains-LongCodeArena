Connecting Steps Together
===========================

To connect steps together in a workflow, you can use the `Graph.connect` method provided by the `mflowgen` library. This method allows you to establish dependencies between steps by connecting their input and output handles.

Input and Output Handles
------------------------

Each step in a workflow has input and output handles that can be used to connect them. You can obtain these handles using the following methods:

- `get_input_handle(name)`: Returns the input handle for the specified input name.
- `get_output_handle(name)`: Returns the output handle for the specified output name.

You can also use the following syntactic sugar methods for convenience:

- `i(name)`: Equivalent to `get_input_handle(name)`.
- `o(name)`: Equivalent to `get_output_handle(name)`.

Connecting Steps
----------------

To connect steps together, you need to use the input and output handles of the respective steps. Here is an example of how you can connect steps using the `Graph.connect` method:

```python
# Assuming step1 and step2 are instances of Step class
graph.connect(step1.o('output_name'), step2.i('input_name'))
```

This code snippet connects the output named `'output_name'` of `step1` to the input named `'input_name'` of `step2`.

Extending Inputs, Outputs, and Commands
---------------------------------------

You can also extend the inputs, outputs, and commands of a step using the following methods:

- `extend_inputs(new_list)`: Extends the list of inputs with the elements in `new_list`.
- `extend_outputs(new_list)`: Extends the list of outputs with the elements in `new_list`.
- `pre_extend_commands(new_list)`: Extends the list of commands at the beginning with the elements in `new_list`.
- `extend_commands(new_list)`: Extends the list of commands with the elements in `new_list`.

These methods provide flexibility in modifying the inputs, outputs, and commands of a step to suit the workflow requirements.
