Gaussian Processes
==================

Kernels for Gaussian process regression and classification.

The kernels in this module allow kernel-engineering, i.e., they can be
combined via the "+" and "*" operators or be exponentiated with a scalar
via "**". These sum and product expressions can also contain scalar values,
which are automatically converted to a constant kernel.

All kernels allow (analytic) gradient-based hyperparameter optimization.
The space of hyperparameters can be specified by giving lower und upper
boundaries for the value of each hyperparameter (the search space is thus
rectangular). Instead of specifying bounds, hyperparameters can also be
declared to be "fixed", which causes these hyperparameters to be excluded from
optimization.

Classes
-------

Hyperparameter
    A kernel hyperparameter's specification in form of a namedtuple.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the hyperparameter. Note that a kernel using a
        hyperparameter with name "x" must have the attributes self.x and
        self.x_bounds

    value_type : str
        The type of the hyperparameter. Currently, only "numeric"
        hyperparameters are supported.

    bounds : pair of floats >= 0 or "fixed"
        The lower and upper bound on the parameter. If n_elements>1, a pair
        of 1d array with n_elements each may be given alternatively. If
        the string "fixed" is passed as bounds, the hyperparameter's value
        cannot be changed.

    n_elements : int, default=1
        The number of elements of the hyperparameter value. Defaults to 1,
        which corresponds to a scalar hyperparameter. n_elements > 1
        corresponds to a hyperparameter which is vector-valued,
        such as, e.g., anisotropic length-scales.

    fixed : bool, default=None
        Whether the value of this hyperparameter is fixed, i.e., cannot be
        changed during hyperparameter tuning. If None is passed, the "fixed" is
        derived based on the given bounds.

Kernel
    Base class for all kernels.

    Methods
    -------
    get_params(self, deep=True)
        Get parameters of this kernel.

        Parameters
        ----------
        deep : bool, default=True
            If True, will return the parameters for this estimator and
            contained subobjects that are estimators.

        Returns
        -------
        params : dict
            Parameter names mapped to their values.
