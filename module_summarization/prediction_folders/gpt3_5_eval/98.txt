# Contract Documentation

The `Contract` class serves as a base class for Contract proxy classes that interact with smart contracts over a Web3 connector. To create Contract classes, you can use the `construct_contract_factory` function with compiled Solidity contract ABI definitions as input. The resulting class object will be a subclass of the `Contract` base class.

## Initializing Contract Objects

To interact with smart contracts, you can perform the following actions:

1. **Create a Contract Proxy Object**: Instantiate a Contract proxy object for an existing deployed smart contract by providing its address using the `__init__` method.
   
2. **Deploy a New Smart Contract**: Deploy a new smart contract using the `Contract.deploy` method.

## Class Properties

- `web3`: A class property that is set during class construction.

## Instance Properties

- `address`: The address of the smart contract.

## Methods

### `__init__(abi=None, address=None, code=None, code_runtime=None, source=None)`

Create a new smart contract proxy object with the specified parameters.

- `abi`: Override the class-level ABI definition.
- `address`: Contract address as a hexadecimal string.
- `code`: Override the class-level code definition.
- `code_runtime`: Override the class-level runtime code definition.
- `source`: Override the class-level source code definition.

### `deploy(transaction=None, args=None, kwargs=None)`

Deploys the contract on a blockchain.

- `transaction`: Transaction parameters for the deployment transaction as a dictionary.
- `args`: Contract constructor arguments as positional arguments.
- `kwargs`: Contract constructor arguments as keyword arguments.

Returns: Hexadecimal transaction hash of the deployment transaction.

### `encodeABI(fn_name, args=None, kwargs=None, data=None)`

Encodes the arguments using the Ethereum ABI for the contract function that matches the given name and arguments.

- `fn_name`: Name of the contract function.
- `args`: Positional arguments for the function.
- `kwargs`: Keyword arguments for the function.
- `data`: Defaults to function selector.

### `on(event_name, filter_params=None, *callbacks)`

Register a callback to be triggered on the appropriate events.

- `event_name`: Name of the event.
- `filter_params`: Additional filter parameters for the event.
- `callbacks`: Callback functions to be triggered.

## Properties

### `abi`

Returns the contract ABI. If not specified, an `AttributeError` is raised.

### `code`

Returns the contract code. If not specified, an `AttributeError` is raised.

### `code_runtime`

Returns the contract runtime code. If not specified, an `AttributeError` is raised.

### `source`

Returns the contract source code. If not specified, an `AttributeError` is raised.
