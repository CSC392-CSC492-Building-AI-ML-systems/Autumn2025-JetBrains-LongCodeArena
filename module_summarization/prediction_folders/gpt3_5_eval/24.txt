======

Initialize a new WEST simulation, creating the WEST HDF5 file and preparing the first iteration's segments.

Initial states are generated from one or more "basis states" which are specified either in a file specified with --bstates-from, or by one or more "--bstate" arguments. If neither --bstates-from nor at least one "--bstate" argument is provided, then a default basis state of probability one identified by the state ID zero and label "basis" will be created (a warning will be printed in this case, to remind you of this behavior, in case it is not what you wanted).

Target states for (non-equilibrium) steady-state simulations are specified either in a file specified with --tstates-from, or by one or more --tstate arguments. If neither --tstates-from nor at least one --tstate argument is provided, then an equilibrium simulation (without any sinks) will be performed.

Options
-------

--force
    Overwrite any existing simulation data.

--bstate-file, --bstates-from BSTATE_FILE
    Read basis state names, probabilities, and (optionally) data references from BSTATE_FILE.

--bstate
    Add the given basis state (specified as a string 'label,probability[,auxref]') to the list of basis states (after those specified in --bstates-from, if any). This argument may be specified more than once, in which case the given states are appended in the order they are given on the command line.

--tstate-file, --tstates-from TSTATE_FILE
    Read target state names and representative progress coordinates from TSTATE_FILE. WESTPA uses the representative progress coordinate of a target state and converts the entire bin containing that progress coordinate into a recycling sink.

--tstate
    Add the given target state (specified as a string 'label,pcoord0[,pcoord1[,...]]') to the list of target states (after those specified in the file given by --tstates-from, if any). This argument may be specified more than once, in which case the given states are appended in the order they appear on the command line.

--sstate-file, --sstates-from SSTATE_FILE
    Read start state names, probabilities, and (optionally) data references from SSTATE_FILE.

--sstate
    Add the given start state (specified as a string 'label,probability[,auxref]') to the list of start states (after those specified in --sstates-from, if any). This argument may be specified more than once, in which case the given states are appended in the order they are given on the command line.

--segs-per-state N
    Initialize N segments from each basis state (default: 1).

--no-we, --shotgun
    Do not run the weighted ensemble bin/split/merge algorithm on newly-created segments.
