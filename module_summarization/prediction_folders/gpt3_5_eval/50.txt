Generate Example
================

To demonstrate the usage of the provided code for spline and other smoother classes for Generalized Additive Models, we will walk through a simple example of generating a B-spline basis for a given dataset.

First, we need to import the necessary classes and functions:

.. code-block:: python

    from generalized_additive_model import GLMGam
    from gam_cross_validation.gam_cross_validation import MultivariateGAMCVPath
    from smooth_basis import BSplines, CyclicCubicSplines
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from patsy import dmatrix

Next, we will define a dataset `x` and the desired degrees of freedom `df` and degree of the spline `degree`:

.. code-block:: python

    x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
    df = 5
    degree = 3

We can then compute the B-spline basis using the provided functions:

.. code-block:: python

    basis, der_basis, der2_basis = make_bsplines_basis(x, df, degree)

This will generate the B-spline basis along with its first and second derivatives. Additionally, we can obtain the knots for the B-splines using the function `get_knots_bsplines`:

.. code-block:: python

    all_knots = get_knots_bsplines(x=x, df=df, degree=degree)

The `all_knots` variable will contain the knots required for constructing the B-splines. This example showcases the functionality of the spline and smoother classes for Generalized Additive Models provided in the code.
