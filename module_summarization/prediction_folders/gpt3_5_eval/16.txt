Plothist Command
================

The `Plothist` command is used to generate histograms and plots from histogram data stored in an HDF5 file. This command is part of the WESTPA package and provides various options for customizing the plots generated.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    plothist INPUT [DIMENSION] [OPTIONS]

Arguments
---------

- ``INPUT``: HDF5 file containing histogram data.

- ``DIMENSION``: Optional argument specifying the dimension for which to plot the histogram. It is specified as ``INT[:[LB,UB]:LABEL]``, where:
  - ``INT`` is a zero-based integer identifying the dimension in the histogram.
  - ``LB`` and ``UB`` are the lower and upper bounds for plotting.
  - ``LABEL`` is the label for the plot axis. (Default: dimension 0, full range.)

Options
-------

- ``-o, --output, --plot-output PLOT_OUTPUT``: Store the plot as ``PLOT_OUTPUT``. The output format is determined by the filename extension (default: "hist.pdf").

- ``--hdf5-output HDF5_OUTPUT``: Store plot data in the HDF5 file ``HDF5_OUTPUT``.

- ``--plot-contour``: Determines whether or not to superimpose a contour plot over the heatmap for 2D objects.

- ``--title TITLE``: Include ``TITLE`` as the top-of-graph title.

- ``--linear``: Plot the histogram on a linear scale.

- ``--energy``: Plot the histogram on an inverted natural log scale, corresponding to (free) energy (default).

- ``--zero-energy E``: Set the zero of energy to ``E``, which may be a scalar, "min" or "max".

- ``--log10``: Plot the histogram on a base-10 log scale.

- ``--range LB,UB``: Plot histogram ordinates over the given range, where ``LB`` and ``UB`` are the lower and upper bounds, respectively. For 1-D plots, this is the Y axis. For 2-D plots, this is the colorbar axis. (Default: full range.)

- ``--postprocess-function FUNCTION``: Names a function (as in module.function) that will be called just prior to saving the plot. The function will be called as ``postprocess(hist, midpoints, binbounds)`` where:
  - ``hist`` is the histogram that was plotted.
  - ``midpoints`` is the bin midpoints for each dimension.
  - ``binbounds`` is the bin boundaries for each dimension for 2-D plots, or None otherwise. The plot must be modified in place using the pyplot stateful interface.

Defaults
--------

By default, the histogram is plotted on an inverted natural log scale corresponding to (free) energy.
