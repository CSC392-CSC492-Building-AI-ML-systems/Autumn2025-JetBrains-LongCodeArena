    Extract fluxes into pre-defined target states from WEST data,
    average, and construct confidence intervals. Monte Carlo bootstrapping
    is used to account for the correlated and possibly non-Gaussian statistical
    error in flux measurements.

    All non-graphical output (including that to the terminal and HDF5) assumes that
    the propagation/resampling period ``tau`` is equal to unity; to obtain results
    in familiar units, divide all fluxes and multiply all correlation lengths by
    the true value of ``tau``.
