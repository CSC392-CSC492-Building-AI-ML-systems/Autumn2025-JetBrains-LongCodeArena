# Convolution Module Built-in Kernels

The Convolution module in Astropy provides built-in kernels that can be used for convolution operations. These kernels are designed to be efficient and optimized for various tasks in signal processing and image processing.

## Available Kernels

1. **Kernel1D**: Represents a one-dimensional kernel that can be used for convolving one-dimensional data.
2. **Kernel2D**: Represents a two-dimensional kernel that can be used for convolving two-dimensional data.

## Special Operators

The Convolution module also provides special operators that can be applied to kernels for specific operations. These operators include:

- **MAX_NORMALIZATION**: A normalization method that ensures the kernel values are scaled to the maximum value.
- **CompoundModel**: Allows combining multiple kernels into a single compound model for more complex convolution operations.

## Boundary Options

When performing convolution operations, the Convolution module supports various boundary options that can be specified. These options include:

- **None**: No boundary handling is applied.
- **fill**: The boundary is filled with a specified value.
- **wrap**: The data is wrapped around at the boundary.
- **extend**: The boundary is extended by replicating the edge values.

## Next Fast Lengths

The module provides a function `_next_fast_lengths` that calculates optimal or good sizes to pad an array for better performance with FFT operations. This function ensures that the array is padded to sizes that are efficient for FFT calculations.

## Copy Input Function

The `_copy_input_if_needed` function is available to handle input data for convolution operations. It allows for copying the input data if necessary, handling NaN values, masking, and specifying fill values for interpolation.

These built-in kernels and functions in the Convolution module provide a comprehensive set of tools for performing convolution operations efficiently and effectively in Astropy.
