============

The ``w_multi_west`` command is a tool designed to combine multiple WESTPA simulations while accounting for reweighting.

Command-line options
--------------------

- ``-o``, ``--output-file``: The name of the output file to store results in.
- ``-W``, ``--west``, ``--WEST_H5FILE``: The name of the main.h5 file inside each simulation directory.
- ``-a``, ``--aux``: Names of additional auxiliary datasets to be combined.
- ``-aa``, ``--auxall``: Combine all auxiliary datasets. Default: False.
- ``-nr``, ``--no-reweight``: Do not reweight. Default: False.
- ``-ib``, ``--ibstates``: Attempt to combine ibstates dataset. Default: False.

Description
-----------

The ``w_multi_west`` command combines multiple WESTPA simulations while considering reweighting. It provides options to specify the output file, the main.h5 file in each simulation directory, additional auxiliary datasets to combine, whether to combine all auxiliary datasets, whether to reweight, and whether to attempt to combine the ibstates dataset.

This tool is useful for merging data from multiple WESTPA simulations into a single output file, taking into account the reweighting factors applied during the simulations. By using the ``w_multi_west`` command, users can efficiently analyze and compare results from different WESTPA simulations in a consolidated manner.
