# Working with User Security Roles

To work with user security roles in ftrack, you can use the `Session` class provided by the `ftrack_api` module. The `Session` class allows you to interact with an ftrack server in an isolated manner.

## Initializing a Session

To initialize a session for working with user security roles, you can create an instance of the `Session` class. The `Session` class constructor accepts various parameters that allow you to configure the session, such as:

- `server_url`: The URL of the ftrack server to connect to.
- `api_key`: The API key to use for authentication.
- `api_user`: The username of the user in ftrack to record operations against.
- `auto_populate`: A flag that determines whether entity attributes should be automatically fetched from the server.
- `plugin_paths`: A list of paths to search for plugins.
- `cache`: An instance of a cache that will be used for caching data.
- `auto_connect_event_hub`: A flag that determines whether the event hub should be automatically connected.
- `schema_cache_path`: A folder path for enabling schema caching.
- `plugin_arguments`: Optional keyword arguments to pass to plugin register functions.

```python
session = Session(
    server_url='https://your-ftrack-server-url',
    api_key='your-api-key',
    api_user='your-username',
    auto_populate=True,
    plugin_paths=['/path/to/plugins'],
    cache=None,
    cache_key_maker=None,
    auto_connect_event_hub=True,
    schema_cache_path='/path/to/schema/cache',
    plugin_arguments={'arg1': 'value1', 'arg2': 'value2'}
)
```

## Authenticating the Session

To authenticate the session with the ftrack server, the `SessionAuthentication` class is used. This class attaches ftrack session authentication information to requests made by the session.

```python
auth = SessionAuthentication(api_key='your-api-key', api_user='your-username')
```

## Managing User Security Roles

Once you have initialized a session and authenticated it, you can manage user security roles by interacting with the ftrack server using the session instance. The session provides methods and attributes for working with user security roles, such as:

- `recorded_operations`: A collection of currently pending operations.
- `record_operations`: A flag that determines whether operations should be recorded.
- `cache_key_maker`: An instance of a key maker used for generating cache keys.

By utilizing the session's capabilities, you can effectively work with user security roles in ftrack and perform various operations related to security management.
