Generate documentation for this module:

The module provides functionality for managing migrations in Piccolo applications. It includes classes such as `BackwardsMigrationManager` and `CheckMigrationManager` for handling migration operations like running migrations backwards and checking migration statuses.

The `BackwardsMigrationManager` class allows users to reverse migrations up to a specific migration ID or all migrations. It provides options for auto-agreeing to prompts, cleaning up migration files, and previewing SQL queries before execution.

The `CheckMigrationManager` class is used to retrieve the status of migrations for a specific app. It includes a method `get_migration_statuses` that returns a list of `MigrationStatus` data classes containing information about each migration, such as the app name, migration ID, description, and whether it has been executed.

Additionally, the module includes utility functions for running migrations backwards, undoing migrations for multiple apps, and handling user input prompts during the migration process.

Overall, this module offers a comprehensive set of tools for managing migrations in Piccolo applications, making it easier for developers to handle database schema changes efficiently and effectively.
