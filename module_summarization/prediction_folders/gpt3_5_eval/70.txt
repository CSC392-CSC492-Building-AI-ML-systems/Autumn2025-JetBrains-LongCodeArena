PolynomialCountSketch
    Polynomial kernel approximation via Tensor Sketch.

    Implements Tensor Sketch, which approximates the feature map of the polynomial kernel:

    .. math::

        K(X, Y) = (\gamma \cdot <X, Y> + coef0)^{degree}

    by efficiently computing a Count Sketch of the outer product of a vector with itself using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). Read more in the User Guide.

    **Parameters:**

    - ``gamma`` : float, default=1.0
        Parameter of the polynomial kernel whose feature map will be approximated.
    - ``degree`` : int, default=2
        Degree of the polynomial kernel whose feature map will be approximated.
    - ``coef0`` : int, default=0
        Constant term of the polynomial kernel whose feature map will be approximated.
    - ``n_components`` : int, default=100
        Dimensionality of the output feature space.
    - ``random_state`` : int, RandomState instance, default=None
        Determines random number generation for indexHash and bitHash initialization.

    **Attributes:**

    - ``indexHash_`` : ndarray of shape (degree, n_features), dtype=int64
        Array of indexes used to represent the 2-wise independent hash functions for Count Sketch computation.
    - ``bitHash_`` : ndarray of shape (degree, n_features), dtype=float32
        Array with random entries in {+1, -1} used to represent the 2-wise independent hash functions for Count Sketch computation.
    - ``n_features_in_`` : int
        Number of features seen during fit.
    - ``feature_names_in_`` : ndarray of shape (n_features_in_,)
        Names of features seen during fit. Defined only when X has feature names that are all strings.

    **Examples:**

    >>> from sklearn.kernel_approximation import PolynomialCountSketch
    >>> from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier
    >>> X = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]]
    >>> y = [0, 0, 1, 1]
    >>> ps = PolynomialCountSketch(degree=3, random_state=1)
    >>> X_features = ps.fit_transform(X)
    >>> clf = SGDClassifier(max_iter=10, tol=1e-3)
    >>> clf.fit(X_features, y)
    SGDClassifier(max_iter=10)
    >>> clf.score(X_features, y)
    1.0
