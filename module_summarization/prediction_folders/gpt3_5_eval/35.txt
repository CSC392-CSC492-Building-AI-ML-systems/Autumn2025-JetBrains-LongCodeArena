w_states
========

Display or manipulate basis (initial) or target (recycling) states for a WEST simulation. By default, states are displayed (or dumped to files). If ``--replace`` is specified, all basis/target states are replaced for the next iteration. If ``--append`` is specified, the given target state(s) are appended to the list for the next iteration.

Appending basis states is not permitted, as this would require renormalizing basis state probabilities in ways that may be error-prone. Instead, use ``w_states --show --bstate-file=bstates.txt`` and then edit the resulting ``bstates.txt`` file to include the new desired basis states, then use ``w_states --replace --bstate-file=bstates.txt`` to update the WEST HDF5 file appropriately.

Modes of Operation
------------------

- ``--show``: Display current basis/target states (or dump to files).
- ``--append``: Append the given basis/target states to those currently in use.
- ``--replace``: Replace current basis/target states with those specified.

Arguments
---------

- ``--bstate-file BSTATE_FILE``: Read (--append/--replace) or write (--show) basis state names, probabilities, and data references from/to BSTATE_FILE.
- ``--bstate``: Add the given basis state (specified as a string 'label,probability[,auxref]') to the list of basis states (after those specified in --bstate-file, if any). This argument may be specified more than once, in which case the given states are appended in the order they are given on the command line.
- ``--tstate-file TSTATE_FILE``: Read (--append/--replace) or write (--show) target state names and representative progress coordinates from/to TSTATE_FILE.
- ``--tstate``: Add the given target state (specified as a string 'label,pcoord0[,pcoord1[,...]]') to the list of target states (after those specified in the file given by --tstates-from, if any). This argument may be specified more than once, in which case the given states are appended in the order they appear on the command line.

Default Mode
------------

The default mode is ``--show``.

Initialization
--------------

The ``initialize`` function is responsible for setting up the work manager, system driver, and data manager based on the specified mode and arguments. It handles displaying, replacing, or appending basis/target states for the WEST simulation.
