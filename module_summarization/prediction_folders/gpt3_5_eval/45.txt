# Module Documentation: Logging

The `Logging` module provides functionality for configuring and managing logging within an application. It includes features for setting up console logging, file logging, and syslog logging. The module also defines custom log levels and log formatters for different output formats.

## Classes

### Logging

- **Methods:**
  - `__init__(self, app)`: Initializes the `Logging` object with the specified application instance.
  - `_configure_console_logging()`: Configures console logging if needed.
  - `_on_tick_rotate_check()`: Callback function for log rotation checks.
  - `schedule(app, interval)`: Schedules log rotation based on the specified interval.

- **Attributes:**
  - `RootLogger`: The root logger instance.
  - `ConsoleHandler`: Handler for console logging.
  - `FileHandler`: Handler for file logging.
  - `SyslogHandler`: Handler for syslog logging.
  - `LogRotatingTime`: Timer for log rotation scheduling.

## Constants

- `LOG_NOTICE`: Info log level that is visible in non-verbose mode. It should not be used for warnings and errors.

## Configuration

The `Logging` module reads logging configuration settings from the `Config` object, including file paths, log formats, backup settings, and syslog configurations.

## Log Levels

The module defines the following log levels:
- `DEBUG`
- `INFO`
- `NOTICE`
- `WARNING`
- `ERROR`
- `FATAL`
- `CRITICAL`

## Log Formatters

The module uses custom log formatters for different log output formats, including structured data formatting for file logging and various syslog message formats for syslog logging.

## Usage

To use the `Logging` module, create an instance of the `Logging` class and pass the application instance as a parameter. The module will automatically configure logging based on the specified settings in the `Config` object.

For detailed information on configuring and customizing logging behavior, refer to the source code and documentation within the `Logging` module.
