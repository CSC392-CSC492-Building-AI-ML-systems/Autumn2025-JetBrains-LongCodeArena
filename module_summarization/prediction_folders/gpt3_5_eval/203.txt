## Transforming the Prediction Target

The `OneHotEncoder` and `OrdinalEncoder` classes provide functionality for transforming the prediction target in machine learning tasks. These encoders categorize and transform the input features to prepare them for modeling.

### Base Encoder Class

The `_BaseEncoder` class serves as the base class for encoders, containing the necessary code for categorizing and transforming the input features. It includes methods such as `_check_X` for custom array validation, `_fit` for fitting the encoder to the data, and `_transform` for transforming the input data.

#### Custom Array Validation

The `_check_X` method performs custom array validation, converting lists of strings to object dtype and checking for missing values in object dtype data. It constructs a list of features to preserve the data types of pandas DataFrame columns.

#### Fitting the Encoder

The `_fit` method fits the encoder to the input data, handling unknown categories, infrequent categories, and returning category counts if specified. It ensures that the predefined categories match the data and handles unknown categories based on the specified strategy.

#### Transforming the Data

The `_transform` method transforms the input data using the fitted encoder, handling unknown categories, infrequent categories, and ignoring specified category indices. It converts the input features into integer representations for modeling.

By utilizing these encoder classes and methods, you can effectively preprocess and transform the prediction target to facilitate machine learning tasks.
