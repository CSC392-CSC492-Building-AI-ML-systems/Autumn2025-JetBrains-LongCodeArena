Conditions in PyTables
======================

Conditions in PyTables are used to define the indexing information for columns in a Table dataset. The `Index` class represents the index of a column in a table and provides functionality for managing indexing information. An Index is always associated with one and only one column in the table.

Parameters
----------

- `parentnode`: The parent `Group` object.
- `name`: The name of the node in its parent group.
- `atom`: An `Atom` object representing the shape and type of the atomic objects to be saved.
- `title`: Sets a TITLE attribute of the Index entity.
- `kind`: The desired kind for this index ('full', 'medium', 'light', or 'ultralight').
- `optlevel`: The desired optimization level for this index.
- `filters`: An instance of the `Filters` class providing information about the desired I/O filters.
- `tmp_dir`: The directory for temporary files.
- `expectedrows`: An estimate about the number of row slices to be added to the growable dimension.
- `byteorder`: The byteorder of the index datasets on-disk.
- `blocksizes`: The sizes of the compound blocks in index datasets.

Attributes
----------

- `kind`: The kind of the index ('ultralight', 'light', 'medium', or 'full').
- `filters`: Filter properties for this index.
- `dirty`: Indicates whether the index is dirty or not.
- `column`: The `Column` instance for the indexed column.
- `table`: Accessor for the `Table` object of this index.
- `nblockssuperblock`: The number of blocks in a superblock.
- `nslicesblock`: The number of slices in a block.
- `nchunkslice`: The number of chunks in a slice.
- `nsuperblocks`: The number of superblocks.

Note
----

The `Index` class is mainly intended for internal use, but some of its documented attributes and methods may be useful for the programmer.
