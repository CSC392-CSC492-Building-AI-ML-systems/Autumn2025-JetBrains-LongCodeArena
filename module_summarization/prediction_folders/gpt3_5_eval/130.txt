# Less Frequently Used FITS Data Structures

In the astropy.io.fits module, there are several less frequently used FITS data structures available for handling FITS files. These data structures provide additional functionality and flexibility for working with FITS data. Below are some of the less frequently used FITS data structures:

## VerifyError and VerifyWarning Classes

- `VerifyError`: This exception class is raised when a verification error occurs during the verification process.
- `VerifyWarning`: This warning class is raised when a verification warning occurs during the verification process.

## VERIFY_OPTIONS List

The `VERIFY_OPTIONS` list contains various options that can be used for verification. These options include:
- "ignore"
- "warn"
- "exception"
- "fix"
- "silentfix"
- "fix+ignore"
- "fix+warn"
- "fix+exception"
- "silentfix+ignore"
- "silentfix+warn"
- "silentfix+exception"

## _Verify Class

The `_Verify` class provides shared methods for verification. It includes methods such as:
- `run_option`: Executes the verification with the selected option.
- `verify`: Verifies all values in the instance based on the specified verification option.

## _ErrList Class

The `_ErrList` class is a verification errors list class with a nested list structure. It is used to store error messages generated by verifications at different class levels. The class provides methods such as:
- `iter_lines`: Iterates through the nested structure as a list of strings with appropriate indentations for each level of the structure.

## NotifierMixin Class

The `NotifierMixin` class is a mixin class that provides services for registering listeners to changes on objects. It includes methods such as:
- `_add_listener`: Registers a listener on an instance of the notifier.
- `_notify`: Updates all listeners upon changes by calling the appropriate update method on each listener.

These less frequently used FITS data structures offer additional capabilities for handling FITS files and performing verifications on FITS data.
