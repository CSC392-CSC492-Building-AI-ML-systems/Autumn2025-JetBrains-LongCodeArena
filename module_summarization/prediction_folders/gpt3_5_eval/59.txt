# Quantile Regression

The `QuantReg` module provides functionality for estimating a quantile regression model using iterative reweighted least squares. This method allows for the estimation of model parameters by iteratively updating the weights of the observations based on the residuals. The asymptotic covariance matrix is estimated using kernel density estimation, with options for different kernels and bandwidth selection methods.

## Overview

The `QuantReg` module implements the quantile regression model, which is useful for estimating the conditional quantiles of a response variable given certain explanatory variables. It extends the traditional linear regression model by allowing for the estimation of quantiles other than the mean.

## Usage

To use the `QuantReg` module, instantiate the `QuantReg` class with the endogenous (response) and exogenous (explanatory) variables. The `fit` method can then be called to estimate the model parameters using iterative weighted least squares. Users can specify the quantile of interest, the method for calculating the variance-covariance matrix, the kernel for kernel density estimation, and the bandwidth selection method.
