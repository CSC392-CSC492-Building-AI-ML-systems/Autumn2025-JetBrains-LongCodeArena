Generate documentation for the `discretemod` module:

The `discretemod` module provides classes and functions for fitting zero-inflated count models. This module includes the following classes:

- `ZeroInflatedPoisson`: A class for fitting a zero-inflated Poisson model.
- `ZeroInflatedGeneralizedPoisson`: A class for fitting a zero-inflated Generalized Poisson model.
- `ZeroInflatedNegativeBinomialP`: A class for fitting a zero-inflated Negative Binomial model.

Additionally, the module contains a generic class `GenericZeroInflated` that serves as a base class for zero-inflated count models. This class allows for the fitting of zero-inflated models for count data with various options such as specifying the inflation model (Logit or Probit) and handling missing values.

The `GenericZeroInflated` class includes methods for computing the log-likelihood function of the model, fitting the model using maximum likelihood estimation, and calculating the log-likelihood for individual observations. The log-likelihood functions take into account the zero-inflation component of the model and the main count model.

Overall, the `discretemod` module provides a flexible framework for fitting and analyzing zero-inflated count models, allowing users to customize the model specifications and handle different types of count data effectively.
