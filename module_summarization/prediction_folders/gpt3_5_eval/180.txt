Cross-validation is a technique used for evaluating the performance of an estimator. It involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, training the estimator on a portion of the data, and then evaluating its performance on the remaining data. This process is repeated multiple times to ensure robustness and reliability of the performance metrics.

The `LearningCurveDisplay` class provides a visualization of the learning curve, which shows how the performance of an estimator changes as the number of training examples increases. This visualization can help in understanding the relationship between training set size and model performance.

Key parameters of the `LearningCurveDisplay` class include `train_sizes`, `train_scores`, and `test_scores`, which represent the number of training examples, the scores on the training sets, and the scores on the test set, respectively. Additionally, the `score_name` parameter allows customization of the score name used in the learning curve visualization.

The class also provides attributes such as `ax_` (matplotlib Axes), `figure_` (matplotlib Figure), `errorbar_`, `lines_`, and `fill_between_` for further customization and analysis of the learning curve visualization.

For more information on how to use the `LearningCurveDisplay` class and details on the learning curve visualization, refer to the User Guide on visualizations and the specific documentation on learning curve visualization.
