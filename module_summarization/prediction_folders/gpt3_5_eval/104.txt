# Diophantine Equation Solver Documentation

The `diophantine` module provides functionality for solving Diophantine equations, which are polynomial equations with integer solutions. The module contains functions for simplifying the solution procedure of Diophantine equations and converting them into a product of terms that should equal zero.

## Functions

### `diophantine(eq, param=symbols('t', integer=True), syms=None)`

Simplify the solution procedure of a Diophantine equation `eq` by converting it into a product of terms which should equal zero. The output is a set of tuples representing the solutions for each variable in the equation.

#### Parameters

- `eq`: Relational or Expr
  - An equation to be solved.
- `param`: Symbol, optional
  - The parameter to be used in the solution.
- `syms`: list of Symbol's, optional
  - Determines the order of the elements in the returned tuple.

#### Examples

```python
>>> diophantine(x**2 - y**2)
{(t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0)}

>>> diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))
{(0, n1, n2), (t_0, t_1, 2*t_0 + 3*t_1)}

>>> diophantine(x**2 + 3*x*y + 4*x)
{(0, n1), (3*t_0 - 4, -t_0)}
```
