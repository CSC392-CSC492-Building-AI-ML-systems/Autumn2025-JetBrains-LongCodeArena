Ploterr Command
===============

The Ploterr command is used to plot generic expectation/CI data from an HDF5 file and dataset. This command requires the path to the HDF5 file and the dataset within it, which must be provided in the format FILENAME/PATH[SLICE]. If the dataset is not a vector (one dimensional), a slice must be provided. For example, to access the state 0 to state 1 rate evolution calculated by ``w_kinavg``, one would use ``kinavg.h5/rate_evolution[:,0,1]``.

Command-line Arguments
----------------------

- ``-o``, ``--output``: Write the plot to the specified OUTPUT file. The format of the output file will be determined by the filename extension. Default output file is 'errbars.pdf'.
- ``dsspec``: Specify the data location using DSSPEC, which must be formatted as FILENAME/PATH[SLICE]. FILENAME is the HDF5 file to read, PATH is the HDF5 path to the dataset, and SLICE, if provided, must be the Numpy-style slice (including brackets) which selects a vector of data of the appropriate type.

Additional Notes
----------------

- The dataset to be plotted must be 1-dimensional.
