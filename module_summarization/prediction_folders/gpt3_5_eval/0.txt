# Working with Assignments and Allocations

The `ftrack_api` module provides classes and functions to work with assignments and allocations in an ftrack server. Assignments represent the allocation of tasks or work to specific users or resources, while allocations define the distribution of resources to specific tasks or projects.

## Session Authentication

The `SessionAuthentication` class allows attaching ftrack session authentication information to requests. It requires an API key and a user to initialize and modifies requests to include the necessary headers for authentication.

## Session

The `Session` class represents an isolated session for interaction with an ftrack server. It provides methods for initializing the session with server URL, API key, API user, and other optional parameters. The session can be configured to automatically populate entity attributes, connect to an event hub, and enable schema caching.

### Initialization Parameters

- `server_url`: URL of the ftrack server to connect to.
- `api_key`: API key for authentication.
- `api_user`: Username of the user in ftrack for recording operations.
- `auto_populate`: Flag to automatically fetch entity attributes.
- `plugin_paths`: Paths to search for plugins.
- `cache`: Cache instance for session caching.
- `cache_key_maker`: Key maker for generating cache keys.
- `auto_connect_event_hub`: Flag to automatically connect to the event hub.
- `schema_cache_path`: Folder path for schema caching.
- `plugin_arguments`: Optional keyword arguments for plugin register functions.

### Other Features

- `recorded_operations`: Tracks pending operations.
- `cache_key_maker`: Key maker for cache keys.
- `record_operations`: Flag to record operations.

By utilizing the `Session` class and related authentication mechanisms, users can effectively manage assignments and allocations within an ftrack environment.
