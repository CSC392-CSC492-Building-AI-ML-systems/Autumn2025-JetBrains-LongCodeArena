# Empirical Likelihood

The Empirical Likelihood module provides tools for conducting inference on descriptive statistics using empirical likelihood. This includes hypothesis tests and confidence interval construction for the mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and correlation.

## Functionality

- **DescStat**: This function returns an instance to conduct inference on descriptive statistics via empirical likelihood. It distinguishes between univariate and multivariate instances based on the shape of the input data.

## Optimization Functions

The `_OptFuncts` class contains functions that are optimized or solved during the empirical likelihood estimation process. These functions are used to calculate the log likelihood, gradient, and Hessian for the empirical likelihood problem.

- **_log_star**: Transforms the log of observation probabilities in terms of the Lagrange multiplier to the log 'star' of the probabilities.
- **_hess**: Calculates the Hessian of a weighted empirical likelihood problem.
- **_grad**: Calculates the gradient of a weighted empirical likelihood problem.
- **_modif_newton**: Modified Newton's method for maximizing the log 'star' equation.
