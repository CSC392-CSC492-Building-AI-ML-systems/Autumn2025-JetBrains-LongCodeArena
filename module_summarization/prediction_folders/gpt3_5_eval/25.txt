w_ipa command
==============

The `w_ipa` command stands for WESTPA Interactive Python Analysis. It is a tool that allows you to perform interactive analysis on WESTPA simulation data. With `w_ipa`, you can run traces, view weights, progress coordinates, and more. This tool is considered 'stateful', meaning that the data you access is always from the current analysis scheme and iteration.

Usage
-----

To use `w_ipa`, you can access all properties using `w` or `west`. Here are some common operations you can perform:

- To check the current iteration:
    - `w.iteration` or `west.iteration`
- To set a new iteration:
    - `w.iteration = 100`
- To list and change the current analysis schemes:
    - `w.list_schemes`
    - `w.scheme = OUTPUT FROM w.list_schemes`
- To view states and bins defined in the current analysis scheme:
    - `w.states`
    - `w.bin_labels`
- To access information about the current iteration:
    - `w.current`

Additionally, you can run a trace over a specific segment ID using the `w.trace(seg_id)` function, which returns a dictionary with detailed information about the segment's history.

Note that `w_ipa` is a powerful tool for analyzing WESTPA simulation data and provides a range of functionalities to explore and analyze simulation results effectively.

Happy analyzing!
