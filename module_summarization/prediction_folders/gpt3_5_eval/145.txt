# File Objects

The `ObjectID` class represents an HDF5 identifier. It provides attributes and properties for interacting with HDF5 objects.

Attributes:
- `id`: A read-only attribute representing the HDF5 identifier.
- `locked`: An integer attribute indicating whether the object is locked and cannot be closed explicitly or automatically.
- `_hash`: An internal attribute for hashing purposes.
- `_pyid`: An internal attribute representing the Python identifier of the object.

Properties:
- `fileno`: A property that returns a tuple representing the file number associated with the object.
- `valid`: A property that indicates whether the HDF5 object is valid.

Methods:
- `__cinit__(self, id_)`: Initializes the `ObjectID` instance with the provided HDF5 identifier.
- `__dealloc__(self)`: Deallocates the `ObjectID` instance, unregistering it and handling reference counting issues with the HDF5 identifier.

The `ObjectID` class is part of the h5py library and is used for managing HDF5 identifiers in a Python environment.
