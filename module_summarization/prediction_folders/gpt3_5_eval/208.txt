# Utilities for Developers

This module provides compatibility fixes for older versions of Python, NumPy, and SciPy. It includes various utility functions and classes to assist developers in handling compatibility issues and improving code robustness.

## Compatibility Fixes

### NumPy and SciPy Compatibility

- **Sparse Arrays**: Starting from SciPy version 1.8, sparse arrays have been added. This module includes compatibility fixes for handling sparse arrays in different versions of SciPy.
- **Optimization Functions**: The module includes compatibility fixes for optimization functions like `line_search_wolfe1` and `line_search_wolfe2`.
- **Percentile Calculation**: A compatibility fix is provided for handling the `percentile` function with different versions of NumPy.
- **Mode Calculation**: Compatibility fix for calculating the mode of an array with different versions of SciPy.
- **Sparse Linear Algebra**: Compatibility fix for sparse linear algebra functions, specifically for the `cg` function.

### Threadpool Control

- **Threadpool Controller**: The module provides functions for setting limits and retrieving information about the threadpool controller. This is useful for managing threadpool resources efficiently.

### Deprecated Functions

- **Delayed Function**: The `delayed` function has been moved from `sklearn.utils.fixes` to `sklearn.utils.parallel`. This import path will be removed in version 1.5.

## Backport of Python 3.9's `importlib.resources`

This module includes backports of Python 3.9's `importlib.resources` functions for handling text and binary resources. These functions provide a convenient way to access and read resources from data modules.
