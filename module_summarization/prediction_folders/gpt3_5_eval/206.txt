Linear Support Vector Classification
=======================================

The Linear Support Vector Classification (LinearSVC) is a machine learning model implemented in terms of liblinear, providing more flexibility in penalties and loss functions compared to libsvm. This model is suitable for large datasets and supports both dense and sparse input.

Parameters
----------
- **penalty** : {'l1', 'l2'}, default='l2'
    Specifies the norm used in penalization. 'l2' penalty is standard in SVC, while 'l1' leads to sparse `coef_` vectors.

- **loss** : {'hinge', 'squared_hinge'}, default='squared_hinge'
    Specifies the loss function. 'hinge' is the standard SVM loss, while 'squared_hinge' is the square of the hinge loss.

- **dual** : "auto" or bool, default=True
    Selects the algorithm to solve the dual or primal optimization problem. Use `dual=False` when `n_samples > n_features`.

- **tol** : float, default=1e-4
    Tolerance for stopping criteria.

- **C** : float, default=1.0
    Regularization parameter inversely proportional to strength of regularization.

- **multi_class** : {'ovr', 'crammer_singer'}, default='ovr'
    Determines multi-class strategy if `y` has more than two classes.

- **fit_intercept** : bool, default=True
    Whether to fit an intercept term in the model.

- **intercept_scaling** : float, default=1.0
    Scaling factor for intercept term when `fit_intercept` is True.
