## `plot_raster_path` function

This function plots the raster path for a given plan.

### Parameters:
- `plan` (iterable): Must yield `Msg` objects and not be a co-routine.
- `x_motor` (str): Name of the x motor.
- `y_motor` (str): Name of the y motor.
- `ax` (matplotlib.axes.Axes, optional): The axes to plot to. If None, a new figure + axes will be created.
- `probe_size` (float, optional): If not None, use as the radius of the probe (in the same units as motor positions).
- `lw` (float, optional): Width of lines drawn between points.

### Returns:
A dictionary containing:
- `'path'`: The path plotted.
- `'events'`: The events plotted.

## `summarize_plan` function

This function prints a summary of the plan, showing only moves and where events are created.

### Parameters:
- `plan` (iterable): Must yield `Msg` objects.

## `check_limits` function

This function checks that a plan will not move devices outside of their limits.

### Parameters:
- `plan` (iterable): Must yield `Msg` objects.

Please note that the `print_summary` function is an alias for `summarize_plan` for backward compatibility.
