=======================================

This module provides functionality to read and process GILDAS CLASS files. The main purpose of this module is to read a CLASS file into an :class:`pyspeckit.spectrum.ObsBlock`.

Functions
---------

1. ``print_timing(func)``
    - Decorator function that prints the execution time of the decorated function. Useful for tracking the time taken to read CLASS files.

2. ``ensure_bytes(string)``
    - Ensures that a given string is in byte form, particularly useful for compatibility with Python 2 and 3.

Constants
---------

1. ``filetype_dict``
    - A dictionary mapping file type codes to their corresponding descriptions.

2. ``fileversion_dict``
    - A dictionary mapping file version codes to their corresponding descriptions.

3. ``record_lengths``
    - A dictionary specifying the record lengths for different file versions.

4. ``header_id_numbers``
    - A dictionary mapping header ID numbers to their corresponding descriptions.

5. ``header_id_lengths``
    - A dictionary specifying the lengths of different header IDs.

6. ``keys_lengths``
    - A dictionary containing information about the keys and their lengths for different sections of the CLASS file.

- ``astropy.io.fits``
- ``numpy``
- ``six``
- ``astropy``
- ``pyspeckit``
- ``sys``
- ``re``
