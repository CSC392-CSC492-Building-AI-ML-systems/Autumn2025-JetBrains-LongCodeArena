Quick start
===========

Algorithms implemented in `toppra` require geometric paths that implement the abstract class.

To quickly get started with `toppra`, you can use the `propose_gridpoints` function to generate gridpoints that sufficiently cover a given path. This function operates in multiple passes through the geometric path, estimating the maximum interpolation error for each segment and dividing segments as needed to meet the error threshold. The function returns the proposed gridpoints for the path.

To use the `propose_gridpoints` function, provide the input geometric path, maximum error threshold, maximum number of iterations, and maximum segment length. The function will then generate the gridpoints that best cover the path.

Additionally, `toppra` provides an abstract base class `AbstractGeometricPath` that represents geometric paths. Derived classes should implement methods to evaluate the path at given positions and return the degrees-of-freedom of the path, starting and ending path positions, and waypoints if applicable.

For more advanced usage, you can also utilize the `RaveTrajectoryWrapper` class, which wraps OpenRAVE's `GenericTrajectory` and supports trajectories with quadratic or cubic interpolation. This class represents the trajectory as a piecewise polynomial and provides methods to extract waypoints and create the piecewise polynomial representation.

By leveraging these functionalities, you can quickly start working with geometric paths and trajectories in `toppra` for your motion planning needs.
