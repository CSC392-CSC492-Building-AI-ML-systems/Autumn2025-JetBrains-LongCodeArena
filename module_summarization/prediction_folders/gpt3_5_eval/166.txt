A file interface to nodes for PyTables databases
------------------------------------------------

The `FileNode` module provides a file interface for using inside of PyTables database files. Use the `new_node()` function to create a brand new file node which can be read and written as any ordinary Python file. Use the `open_node()` function to open an existing (i.e. created with `new_node()`) node for read-only or read-write access. Read access is always available. Write access (enabled on new files and files opened with mode 'a+') only allows appending data to a file node.

Currently only binary I/O is supported.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0
   In version 3.0 the module has been completely rewritten to be fully compliant with the interfaces defined in the `io` module.
