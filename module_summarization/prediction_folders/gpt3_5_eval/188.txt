Functions that approximate the feature mappings that correspond to certain kernels:

The `PolynomialCountSketch` class in the `sklearn.kernel_approximation` module implements polynomial kernel approximation via Tensor Sketch. It approximates the feature map of the polynomial kernel, defined as \( K(X, Y) = (\gamma \cdot <X, Y> + \text{coef0})^{degree} \), by efficiently computing a Count Sketch of the outer product of a vector with itself using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). This approximation is achieved by generating a feature map in a high-dimensional space.

### PolynomialCountSketch

#### Parameters:
- `gamma` (float, default=1.0): Parameter of the polynomial kernel.
- `degree` (int, default=2): Degree of the polynomial kernel.
- `coef0` (int, default=0): Constant term of the polynomial kernel.
- `n_components` (int, default=100): Dimensionality of the output feature space.
- `random_state` (int, RandomState instance, default=None): Determines random number generation for initialization.

#### Attributes:
- `indexHash_` (ndarray): Array of indexes for Count Sketch computation.
- `bitHash_` (ndarray): Array with random entries for Count Sketch computation.
- `n_features_in_` (int): Number of features seen during fitting.
- `feature_names_in_` (ndarray): Names of features seen during fitting.

#### Methods:
- `fit(X, y=None)`: Fit the model with training data.
- `transform(X)`: Generate the feature map approximation for new data.

#### Example:
```python
from sklearn.kernel_approximation import PolynomialCountSketch
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier

X = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]]
y = [0, 0, 1, 1]

ps = PolynomialCountSketch(degree=3, random_state=1)
X_features = ps.fit_transform(X)

clf = SGDClassifier(max_iter=10, tol=1e-3)
clf.fit(X_features, y)

score = clf.score(X_features, y)
print(score)  # Output: 1.0
```
