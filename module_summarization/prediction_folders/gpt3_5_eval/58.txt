# Generate description to this module

The `Optimizer` module provides functions that are general enough to be used for fitting any model. These functions are designed to be independent of `LikelihoodModel`, allowing for their reusability across different scenarios.

The main function in this module is `_fit`, which is used for fitting models with an objective function. It takes various parameters such as the initial guess for the solution, the fitting method to be used, maximum number of iterations, and other optional settings for controlling the fitting process.

The `method` parameter in `_fit` allows for different optimization algorithms to be used, such as Newton-Raphson, Nelder-Mead, Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno, Powell's method, conjugate gradient, Newton-conjugate gradient, basin-hopping solver, or a generic `minimize` method which is a wrapper for `scipy.optimize.minimize`.

The module provides detailed information about each solver's specific optional arguments and settings, such as tolerance levels, maximum number of iterations, step sizes, and convergence criteria. Additionally, it explains how certain solvers may ignore specific arguments based on their implementation.

Overall, the `Optimizer` module serves as a versatile tool for optimizing models by providing a flexible and customizable fitting function that can adapt to different optimization requirements.
