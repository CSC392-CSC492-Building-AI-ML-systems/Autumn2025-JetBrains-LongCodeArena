Generate documentation for this module
=======================================

This module provides a collection of utilities to manipulate structured arrays. Most of these functions were initially implemented by John Hunter for matplotlib and have been rewritten and extended for convenience.

Functions
---------

- `append_fields`: Append fields to a structured array.
- `apply_along_fields`: Apply a function to elements along fields of a structured array.
- `assign_fields_by_name`: Assign fields to a structured array by name.
- `drop_fields`: Drop fields from a structured array.
- `find_duplicates`: Find duplicates in a structured array.
- `flatten_descr`: Flatten a structured data-type description.
- `get_fieldstructure`: Get the field structure of a structured array.
- `get_names`: Get the field names of a structured array.
- `get_names_flat`: Get the flattened field names of a structured array.
- `join_by`: Join two structured arrays by a common field.
- `merge_arrays`: Merge multiple structured arrays.
- `rec_append_fields`: Append fields to a record array.
- `rec_drop_fields`: Drop fields from a record array.
- `rec_join`: Join two record arrays.
- `recursive_fill_fields`: Fill fields from one array with fields from another array, supporting nested structures.
- `rename_fields`: Rename fields of a structured array.
- `repack_fields`: Repack fields of a structured array.
- `require_fields`: Ensure that a structured array contains specified fields.
- `stack_arrays`: Stack multiple structured arrays.
- `structured_to_unstructured`: Convert a structured array to an unstructured array.
- `unstructured_to_structured`: Convert an unstructured array to a structured array.

Notes
-----

- The `recursive_fill_fields` function fills fields from one array with fields from another array, supporting nested structures. The `output` array should be at least the same size as the `input` array.

Examples
--------

```python
from numpy.lib import recfunctions as rfn
a = np.array([(1, 10.), (2, 20.)], dtype=[('A', np.int64), ('B', np.float64)])
b = np.zeros((3,), dtype=a.dtype)
rfn.recursive_fill_fields(a, b)
# Output: array([(1, 10.), (2, 20.), (0,  0.)], dtype=[('A', '<i8'), ('B', '<f8')])
```

- The `get_fieldspec` function produces a list of name/dtype pairs corresponding to the dtype fields, handling subarray dtypes.

- The `get_names` function returns the field names of the input datatype as a tuple. If the input datatype has nested structures, the names are returned as tuples.

- The `get_names_flat` function returns the flattened field names of the input datatype as a tuple, handling nested structures by flattening them beforehand.

- The `flatten_descr` function flattens a structured data-type description, making it easier to work with structured arrays.

- The `zip_dtype` function zips together the data types of multiple arrays, either flattened or as is.
