# Generate documentation for the code

The provided code consists of Python classes and functions related to configuring and running prognostic simulations using the FV3 model. Below is a summary of the key classes and functions along with their purpose and usage:

## Classes

### `FV3Config`
- Dataclass representing various fields related to the FV3 model configuration.
- Attributes include `namelist`, `experiment_name`, `data_table`, `field_table`, `forcing`, `orographic_forcing`, and `gfs_analysis_data`.
- Provides a method `asdict()` to convert the class instance to a dictionary.

### `InitialCondition`
- Represents an initial condition for the simulation.
- Attributes include `base_url`, `timestep`, and `restart_categories`.
- Contains a property `overlay` to generate initial condition overlay for the simulation.

### `HighLevelConfig`
- Combines configurations from `UserConfig` and `FV3Config` for prognostic runs.
- Attributes include `base_version`, `initial_conditions`, `duration`, and `zhao_carr_emulation`.
- Provides methods for extracting runtime configurations, calculating physics timestep, and translating into a FV3 configuration dictionary.

## Functions

### `instantiate_dataclass_from`
- Creates an instance of a dataclass with the same attributes as another instance.
- Useful for instantiating parent class from child classes.

### `default_coupler_nml`
- Returns a default coupler namelist configuration.

### `_create_arg_parser`
- Creates an argument parser for parsing command-line arguments related to the configuration.

The code also includes various utility functions and imports necessary modules for configuration and running the FV3 model. For detailed usage and examples of each class and function, refer to the code documentation and docstrings provided within the code itself.
