w_run
=====

The ``w_run`` command is used to start or continue a WESTPA simulation.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    w_run [options]

Options
-------

- ``--oneseg``: Only propagate one segment (useful for debugging propagators).

Description
-----------

The ``w_run`` command initializes and runs a WESTPA simulation. It loads the necessary components such as the simulation manager, system driver, data manager, weighted ensemble (WE) driver, and propagator. The simulation is then executed within a work manager context.

If the work manager is the master, it installs a signal interrupt handler, loads plugins, prepares the run, and then begins the simulation. Upon completion, it finalizes the run. If an exception occurs during the simulation, the process is gracefully shut down.

If the work manager is not the master, it simply runs the simulation.
