# Generate documentation for duration module

The `duration` module provides functions for estimating and inferring cumulative incidence functions for right-censored data. The module includes functions for calculating survival functions, cumulative incidence functions, and their standard errors.

## Functions

### `_calc_survfunc_right(time, status, weights=None, entry=None, compress=True, retall=True)`

Calculate the survival function and its standard error for a single group. This function handles unique times, number of deaths, size of risk set, and calculates survival probabilities. It also computes standard errors using Greenwood's formula or Tsiatis' formula.

### `_calc_incidence_right(time, status, weights=None)`

Calculate the cumulative incidence function and its standard error. This function first calculates the all-cause survival function and then computes cause-specific deaths and cumulative incidence probabilities. It also calculates the standard error of the cumulative incidence function.

### `_checkargs(time, status, entry, freq_weights, exog)`

Check the arguments passed to the functions for consistency. It ensures that the lengths of time and status match, entry times are before event times, and that weights and exogenous variables align with the data.

## Class

### `CumIncidenceRight`

Estimation and inference for a cumulative incidence function. This class provides a framework for estimating cumulative incidence functions for different event types. It supports right censoring and allows for optional frequency weights and exogenous variables to account for violations of independent censoring. The class also includes parameters for band-width multiplier and dimensionality reduction in proportional hazards regression models.

This module is useful for analyzing survival data with right-censoring and can provide valuable insights into the cumulative incidence of events over time.
