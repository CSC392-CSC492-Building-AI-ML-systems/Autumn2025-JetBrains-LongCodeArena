# Using Custom Attributes

In the ftrack API, custom attributes can be defined and used to extend the functionality of entities. Custom attributes allow users to store additional information specific to their workflow or requirements.

To define a custom attribute, you can use the `ftrack_api.attribute` module. Custom attributes can be added to entities such as tasks, shots, assets, etc. and can store various types of data such as strings, integers, floats, booleans, etc.

Here is an example of how to define and use a custom attribute:

```python
# Define a custom attribute for a task
task = session.create('Task', {
    'name': 'Custom Attribute Task',
    'custom_attributes': {
        'my_custom_attribute': 'Custom Value'
    }
})

# Access the custom attribute value
custom_value = task['custom_attributes']['my_custom_attribute']
print(custom_value)  # Output: 'Custom Value'
```

Custom attributes provide flexibility and customization options within the ftrack API, allowing users to tailor the system to their specific needs.
