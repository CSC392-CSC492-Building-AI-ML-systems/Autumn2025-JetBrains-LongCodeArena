Header Interface Transition Guide
=====================================

This guide provides information on transitioning to the new header interface. The header interface has been updated to improve performance and usability. It is important to follow the guidelines outlined in this document to ensure a smooth transition.

VerifyError and VerifyWarning Classes
-------------------------------------

The `VerifyError` and `VerifyWarning` classes are used for handling verification errors and warnings. These classes provide a way to manage errors and warnings during the verification process.

Verify Options
--------------

The `VERIFY_OPTIONS` list contains options for verification, such as "ignore", "warn", "exception", "fix", "silentfix", "fix+ignore", "fix+warn", "fix+exception", "silentfix+ignore", "silentfix+warn", and "silentfix+exception". These options determine how verification is handled and reported.

_Verify Class
-------------

The `_Verify` class contains shared methods for verification. It includes methods for running verification with selected options, fixing errors, and verifying values in the instance.

_ErrList Class
--------------

The `_ErrList` class is a verification errors list class with a nested list structure. It is used to construct error messages generated by verifications at different class levels. The class provides methods for iterating through the nested structure and formatting the error messages.

NotifierMixin Class
-------------------

The `NotifierMixin` class is a mixin class that provides services for registering listeners to changes on objects. It allows objects to register listeners, notify listeners of changes, and update listeners accordingly. This class is intended for internal use to communicate between classes in a generic way.

Additional Modules and Functions
-------------------------------

This guide also covers additional modules and functions related to the header interface transition, such as `gzip`, `io`, `itertools`, `mmap`, `os`, `platform`, `signal`, `sys`, `tempfile`, `textwrap`, `threading`, `warnings`, `weakref`, `contextlib`, `suppress`, `wraps`, `numpy`, `packaging.version`, `astropy.utils.data`, `astropy.utils.exceptions`, `path_like`, `cmp`, `all_integer_types`, and `Version`.

It is recommended to review and understand the changes in the header interface and update any existing code accordingly to ensure compatibility with the new interface.
