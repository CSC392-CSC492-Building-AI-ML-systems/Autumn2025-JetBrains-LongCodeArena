Decision Trees
===============

Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively partitioning the input space into regions, where each region corresponds to a specific class or value. At each step, the algorithm selects the feature and the split point that best separates the data based on a chosen criterion.

The impurity criteria play a crucial role in decision tree algorithms. These criteria measure the homogeneity of a set of samples and are used to determine the best split at each node. The impurity of a node is calculated based on the distribution of classes or values in the samples.

The `Criterion` class serves as an interface for impurity criteria in decision tree algorithms. It provides methods for initializing the criterion, updating statistics, calculating impurity, and evaluating impurity improvements. Subclasses of `Criterion` implement specific impurity criteria such as Gini impurity, entropy, or variance reduction.

Decision Trees are powerful and interpretable models that can handle both numerical and categorical data. They are robust to outliers and can capture complex relationships in the data. However, they are prone to overfitting, especially when the tree depth is not properly controlled.

In practice, decision trees are often used in ensemble methods such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, where multiple trees are combined to improve predictive performance. These ensemble methods help mitigate the overfitting tendencies of individual decision trees and often lead to more accurate models.
