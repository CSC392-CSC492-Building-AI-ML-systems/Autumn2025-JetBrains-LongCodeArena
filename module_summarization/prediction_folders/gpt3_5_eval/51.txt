Generate example for this module
-------------------------------

To demonstrate the functionality of the `Family` class in the one parameter exponential family distributions used by GLM, we can create an example as follows:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   from statsmodels.genmod.families.family import Family
   ```

2. Define a link function and a variance function:

   ```python
   from statsmodels.genmod.families.links import Log
   from statsmodels.genmod.families.varfuncs import Power
   link = Log()
   variance = Power()
   ```

3. Create an instance of the `Family` class:

   ```python
   my_family = Family(link, variance)
   ```

4. Use the methods provided by the `Family` class, such as `starting_mu`, `weights`, `deviance`, `resid_dev`, and `fitted`, to perform calculations on your data:

   ```python
   y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   mu_initial = my_family.starting_mu(y)
   weights = my_family.weights(mu_initial)
   deviance_value = my_family.deviance(y, mu_initial)
   resid_dev_values = my_family.resid_dev(y, mu_initial)
   ```

5. Analyze the results obtained from the `Family` class methods based on your specific use case.

This example illustrates how to utilize the `Family` class for one-parameter exponential families in GLM and showcases the various methods available for statistical computations.
