The Metadata Routing API
========================

The Metadata Routing API provides functionality for routing metadata in scikit-learn.

MetadataRouter
--------------

The `MetadataRouter` class is responsible for routing metadata within scikit-learn. It allows for efficient handling and processing of metadata associated with various components.

MethodMapping
-------------

The `MethodMapping` class defines mappings between methods and metadata in scikit-learn. It enables the association of specific methods with corresponding metadata for streamlined processing.

_raise_for_params
-----------------

The `_raise_for_params` function is used to raise exceptions for invalid parameters within the metadata routing system. It ensures that only valid parameters are accepted for routing metadata.

_routing_enabled
----------------

The `_routing_enabled` function checks whether metadata routing is enabled in the current scikit-learn environment. It provides a mechanism to determine if metadata routing functionality is active.

process_routing
---------------

The `process_routing` function handles the routing of metadata within scikit-learn. It coordinates the flow of metadata through the system, ensuring that it reaches the appropriate components for processing.
