w_trace
=======

The ``w_trace`` command provides functionality for generating a trace of a trajectory segment back to its origin. This trace includes information such as the trajectory summary, endpoint type, basis state, initial state, and relevant data manager details.

Usage
-----

The ``w_trace`` command can be used to construct and return a trajectory trace based on the specified iteration number and segment ID. It allows for retrieving segment-specific data from a dataset within a given data file, considering optional slicing and index data parameters.

Class Methods
-------------

- ``from_data_manager(cls, n_iter, seg_id, data_manager=None)``: Construct and return a trajectory trace based on the last segment identified by ``seg_id`` in the iteration number ``n_iter``.

Instance Methods
----------------

- ``get_segment_data_slice(self, datafile, dsname, n_iter, seg_id, slice_=None, index_data=None, iter_prec=None)``: Return data from the dataset named ``dsname`` within the given ``datafile`` for the specified iteration and segment, considering optional slicing and index data parameters.

- ``trace_timepoint_dataset(self, dsname, slice_=None, auxfile=None, index_ds=None)``: Return a trace along the trajectory over a dataset laid out as [seg_id][timepoint][...], accounting for overlapping values at segment boundaries. Returns a time series of the dataset along the trajectory and the corresponding trajectory weight at each time point.

Attributes
----------

- ``summary``: A summary of the trajectory trace.
- ``endpoint_type``: The type of endpoint for the trajectory.
- ``basis_state``: The basis state associated with the trajectory.
- ``initial_state``: The initial state of the trajectory.
- ``data_manager``: The data manager used for managing trajectory data.
