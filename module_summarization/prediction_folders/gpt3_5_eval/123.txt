The `WithinRoleDeleteView` class implements the preview+confirm+delete workflow. It provides the necessary context data and a base template for views where we have a CRAdmin role. This view is designed to handle the deletion of objects, guiding the user through the process with preview, confirmation, and deletion steps.

Key features of the `WithinRoleDeleteView` class include:

- Setting the page title to "Confirm delete".
- Providing action labels for delete and cancel buttons.
- Displaying a preview of the object to be deleted.
- Showing a confirm message asking the user if they are sure they want to delete the object.
- Specifying the success URL to redirect to after deletion.
- Allowing customization of the success message displayed after deletion.
- Adding success messages using Django's message framework.
- Including necessary context data such as model verbose name, success URL, object preview, page title, confirm message, delete button label, and cancel button label.

By extending the `QuerysetForRoleMixin`, `DeleteViewMixin`, `DjangoDeleteView`, `CommonCradminViewMixin`, and `WithinRoleViewMixin`, the `WithinRoleDeleteView` class combines the functionalities required for handling object deletion within the CRAdmin framework.
