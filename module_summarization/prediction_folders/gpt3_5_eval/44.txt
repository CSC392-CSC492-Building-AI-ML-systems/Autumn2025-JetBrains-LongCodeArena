# Generate documentation for this module

The `AzureStorageLibraryProvider` class is a library provider that reads from a Microsoft Azure Storage container. It can be configured by providing a URL in the format `azure+https://ACCOUNT-NAME.blob.core.windows.net/BLOB-CONTAINER`. If the Container Public Access Level is not set to "Public access," an "Access Policy" with "Read" and "List" permissions and a "Shared Access Signature" (SAS) query string must be added to the URL in the configuration.

## Configuration

To configure the `AzureStorageLibraryProvider`, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the `AzureStorageLibraryProvider` class by passing the library, path, and layer parameters to the constructor.
2. Ensure that the path starts with "azure+".
3. Set up the cache directory based on the configuration settings.
4. Load the model by calling the `_load_model` method asynchronously.
5. List the blobs in the Azure Storage container by calling the `_load_model` method.
6. Read the contents of a specific path in the Azure Storage container by calling the `read` method.

## Methods

### `_start()`

- Asynchronously initializes the `AzureStorageLibraryProvider` instance by loading the model and setting it as ready.

### `_load_model()`

- Asynchronously loads the model by fetching the list of blobs from the Azure Storage container.
- Parses the XML response to create a hierarchical model of directories and items.
- Updates the cache based on the retrieved data.

### `list(path: str) -> list`

- Asynchronously lists the items at the specified path in the Azure Storage container.
- Returns a list of `LibraryItem` objects representing the items found at the path.

### `read(path: str) -> typing.IO`

- Asynchronously reads the contents of the item at the specified path in the Azure Storage container.
- Retrieves the item from the Azure Storage container and caches it if necessary.
- Returns a file-like object containing the contents of the item.

## Logging

- Logs informational messages using the `logging` module to provide status updates and error messages during the execution of the `AzureStorageLibraryProvider` class.

This documentation provides an overview of the `AzureStorageLibraryProvider` class and its methods for interacting with Microsoft Azure Storage containers.
