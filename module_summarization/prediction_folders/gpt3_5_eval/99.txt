# Filters Documentation

The code provided includes the implementation of various filters for monitoring and processing events and data on the Ethereum blockchain. Below is a summary of the filters implemented in the code:

## Event Filters

### `construct_event_filter_params(event_abi, contract_address=None, argument_filters=None, topics=None, fromBlock=None, toBlock=None, address=None)`

This function constructs event filter parameters based on the provided arguments. It generates filter parameters for event topics, addresses, and block ranges.

### `Filter`

A base class for filters that extends `gevent.Greenlet`. It provides functionality for managing callbacks, running the filter, and stopping the filter.

### `BlockFilter`

A subclass of `Filter` specifically for filtering block-related events.

### `TransactionFilter`

A subclass of `Filter` for filtering transaction-related events.

## Data Filters

### `construct_data_filter_regex(data_filter_set)`

This function constructs a regular expression pattern based on the provided data filter set. It is used to match data filters in log entries.

### `LogFilter`

A filter for monitoring log events on the blockchain. It includes functionality for setting data filters, formatting log entries, and validating log entries based on data filters.

### `PastLogFilter`

A subclass of `LogFilter` that retrieves past log entries when initialized. It extends the functionality of `LogFilter` to handle historical log data.

## Whisper Filters

### `ShhFilter`

A filter for monitoring Whisper messages on the Ethereum network. It provides functionality for processing Whisper messages and stopping the filter.
