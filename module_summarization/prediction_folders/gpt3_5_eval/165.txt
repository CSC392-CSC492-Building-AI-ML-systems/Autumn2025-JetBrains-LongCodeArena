# PyTables File Format

PyTables is a Python library that provides a way to manage and store large datasets efficiently. One of the key components of PyTables is its file format, which is designed to optimize data storage and retrieval. This document provides an overview of the PyTables file format.

## Index Class

The `Index` class in PyTables represents the index of a column in a table dataset. It is a subclass of the `Group` class and provides additional functionality for indexing and querying data efficiently.

### Parameters

- `parentnode`: The parent `Group` object.
- `name`: The name of the node in its parent group.
- `atom`: An `Atom` object representing the shape and type of the atomic objects to be saved.
- `title`: Sets a TITLE attribute of the Index entity.
- `kind`: The desired kind for this index.
- `optlevel`: The desired optimization level for this index.
- `filters`: An instance of the `Filters` class for I/O filters.
- `tmp_dir`: The directory for temporary files.
- `expectedrows`: An estimate of the number of row slices to be added.
- `byteorder`: The byte order of the index datasets on disk.
- `blocksizes`: The sizes of compound blocks in index datasets.

### Properties

- `kind`: The kind of the index.
- `filters`: Filter properties for the index.
- `dirty`: Whether the index is dirty or not.
- `column`: The column instance for the indexed column.
- `table`: The `Table` object of this index.
- `nblockssuperblock`: The number of blocks in a superblock.
- `nslicesblock`: The number of slices in a block.
- `nchunkslice`: The number of chunks in a slice.
- `nsuperblocks`: The number of superblocks.

### Additional Information

- The `Index` class is mainly intended for internal use but provides useful attributes and methods for programmers.
- The index can be associated with only one column in a table.
- The index can have different kinds and optimization levels for efficient data retrieval.
- Dirty indexes are out of sync with column data and are not usable until updated.
