Mixed Linear Models Module
==========================

The mixed_linear module provides functionality for fitting linear mixed effects models to data. Linear mixed effects models are regression models that can estimate relationships involving both means and variances. These models are also known as multilevel linear models and hierarchical linear models.

The primary class in this module is MixedLM, which fits linear mixed effects models to data and supports common post-estimation tasks. This implementation is group-based and most efficient for models where the data can be partitioned into independent groups. The model can handle crossed effects by specifying a model with a single group.

Model Structure
---------------

The probability model for group i is defined as:

Y = X * beta + Z * gamma + epsilon

where:
- Y is the response vector for group i
- X is the design matrix for fixed effects
- beta is the vector of fixed effects parameters
- Z is the design matrix for random effects
- gamma is a random vector with mean 0
- epsilon is a vector of iid normal errors

Estimation
----------

The parameters beta, Psi, and sigma^2 are estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. The random effects gamma and epsilon are random and define the probability model.

Marginal Mean Structure
-----------------------

The marginal mean structure is given by E[Y | X, Z] = X * beta. If only the mean structure is of interest, Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) can be an alternative to using linear mixed models.

Random Effects
--------------

Two types of random effects are supported:
1. Standard random effects that are correlated with each other
2. Variance components that are uncorrelated with the standard random effects

Notation
--------

- `cov_re`: Random effects covariance matrix
- `scale`: Scalar error variance
- `vcomp`: Vector of variance parameters

Parameterizations
------------------

Three parameterizations are used:
1. User parameterization
2. Profile parameterization
3. Square root parameterization

Score Methods
-------------

Two score methods are implemented for inference and optimization.

Optimization
------------

Numerical optimization uses Generalized Least Squares (GLS) to avoid explicitly optimizing over fixed effects parameters. The likelihood function is profiled over the scale parameter and fixed effects parameters.

Warnings
--------

ConvergenceWarning may be raised during model fitting.

Dependencies
------------

- numpy
- statsmodels
- scipy
- pandas
- patsy
