Partial Dependence and Individual Conditional Expectation Plots
==================================================================

Partial Dependence Plot
-----------------------

The partial dependence plot shows the marginal effect of a feature on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model. It illustrates how the predicted outcome changes as a specific feature varies while averaging out the effects of all other features. This plot helps in understanding the relationship between the target variable and the feature of interest.

To generate a partial dependence plot, you can use the `partial_dependence` function provided in scikit-learn. This function calculates the average prediction of the model over a grid of feature values for the selected feature, while keeping all other features constant.

Individual Conditional Expectation Plot
---------------------------------------

The individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot visualizes the effect of a single feature on the predicted outcome for each sample individually. Unlike the partial dependence plot that shows the average effect, ICE plots provide a more detailed view by displaying the predicted outcome for each sample as the feature of interest varies.

To create an ICE plot, you can use the `plot_partial_dependence` function in scikit-learn. This function generates ICE curves for a specific feature across multiple samples, allowing you to observe the individual variations in predictions based on that feature.

Both partial dependence and ICE plots are valuable tools for interpreting machine learning models and gaining insights into how features influence the model's predictions. By visualizing the relationship between features and predictions, these plots help in understanding the model's behavior and identifying important features in the dataset.
