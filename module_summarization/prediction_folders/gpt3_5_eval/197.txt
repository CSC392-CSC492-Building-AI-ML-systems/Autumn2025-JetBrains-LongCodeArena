Naive Bayes Methods
===================

The :mod:`sklearn.naive_bayes` module implements Naive Bayes algorithms. These are supervised learning methods based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) feature independence assumptions.

Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)
-----------------------------------

Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a Naive Bayes classifier for multivariate Bernoulli models. It assumes that all features are binary-valued (e.g., zeros and ones).

Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
---------------------------------

Gaussian Naive Bayes is a Naive Bayes classifier for data with continuous features. It assumes that features follow a Gaussian distribution.

Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)
---------------------------------------

Multinomial Naive Bayes is a Naive Bayes classifier for multinomially distributed data. It is suitable for classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts).

Complement Naive Bayes (ComplementNB)
-------------------------------------

Complement Naive Bayes is an adaptation of the standard Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm that is particularly suited for imbalanced data sets.

Categorical Naive Bayes (CategoricalNB)
---------------------------------------

Categorical Naive Bayes is a Naive Bayes classifier for categorical features. It is suitable for classification tasks with features that have a categorical distribution.

For more details on each specific Naive Bayes method, refer to the corresponding class documentation in the :mod:`sklearn.naive_bayes` module.
