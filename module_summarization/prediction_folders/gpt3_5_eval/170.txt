# Handling Large Datasets

This module provides functions for handling large datasets efficiently, particularly when working with spectral cubes containing multiple Stokes parameters. The functions in this module are designed to compute moment maps in various ways, allowing for the analysis of large datasets without running into memory constraints.

## Moment Maps Computation

### `_moment_shp(cube, axis)`

- Returns the shape of the moment map based on the input cube and axis.

### `_slice0(cube, axis)`

- Computes the 0th moment along an axis by calculating it slicewise.

### `_slice1(cube, axis)`

- Computes the 1st moment along an axis by calculating it slicewise.

### `moment_slicewise(cube, order, axis)`

- Computes moments by accumulating the result one slice at a time.

### `moment_raywise(cube, order, axis)`

- Computes moments by accumulating the answer one ray at a time.

### `moment_cubewise(cube, order, axis)`

- Computes the moments by working with the entire data at once.

### `moment_auto(cube, order, axis)`

- Builds a moment map, choosing a strategy to balance speed and memory based on the input cube and axis.

## Stokes Spectral Cube

### `StokesSpectralCube`

- A class to store a spectral cube with multiple Stokes parameters.
- Allows individual Stokes cubes to share a common mask and have component-specific masks.

## Additional Information

- The module also defines valid Stokes parameters that can be used for analysis.
- Provides compatibility with various data formats and utilities for working with WCS information.

By utilizing the functions and classes provided in this module, users can efficiently handle and analyze large datasets, making it easier to extract meaningful insights from complex spectral cube data.
