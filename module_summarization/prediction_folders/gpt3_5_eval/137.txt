# ImPACT: Image Pixel-wise fit for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes

The ImPACT (Image Pixel-wise fit for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes) is an implementation of the impact_reco Monte Carlo Template-based image fitting method as described by Parsons & Hinton in Astroparticle Physics 56 (2014), pp. 26-34.

## Overview

ImPACT performs a maximum likelihood fit for the shower axis, energy, and height of maximum by comparing the predicted image from a library of image templates. This method is computationally intensive and requires fixed units within the class:

- Angular units in radians
- Distance units in meters
- Energy units in TeV

## Features

- Provides a simple estimation of the depth of the shower maximum based on the expected gamma-ray elongation rate.
- Offers prior functions for energy and shower maximum depth.
- Utilizes image template interpolators for different telescope types.
- Includes conversion functions from height above ground to depth of maximum.
- Calculates the peak position of each image in an event for Xmax calculation.

## Class: ImPACTReconstructor

The `ImPACTReconstructor` class is responsible for implementing the ImPACT method. It includes the following key attributes and methods:

- `guess_shower_depth(energy)`: Estimates the depth of the shower maximum based on the energy of the shower.
- `energy_prior(energy, index=-1)`: Defines the prior function for energy.
- `xmax_prior(energy, xmax, width=100)`: Defines the prior function for the shower maximum depth.
- `initialise_templates(tel_type)`: Initializes templates for a given telescope type.
- `get_hillas_mean()`: Finds the peak position of each image in an event for Xmax calculation.
