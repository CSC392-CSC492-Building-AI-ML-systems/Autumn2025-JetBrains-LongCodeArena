# A Quick Dive into Using the API

To start using the ftrack API, you need to create a session object that will allow you to interact with an ftrack server. The `Session` class provides a way to initialize a session with the necessary authentication information and configuration options.

## Initializing a Session

To initialize a session, you can create an instance of the `Session` class with the following parameters:

- `server_url`: The URL of the ftrack server to connect to.
- `api_key`: The API key used for authentication.
- `api_user`: The username of the user in ftrack to record operations against.
- `auto_populate`: A flag that determines whether entity attributes are automatically fetched from the server.
- `plugin_paths`: A list of paths to search for plugins.
- `cache`: An instance of a cache that will be used for caching data.
- `cache_key_maker`: An instance of a key maker used to generate keys for cached objects.
- `auto_connect_event_hub`: A flag indicating whether to automatically connect to the event hub.
- `schema_cache_path`: A folder path for enabling schema caching.
- `plugin_arguments`: Optional keyword arguments to pass to plugin register functions.

## Authentication

The `SessionAuthentication` class provides a way to attach ftrack session authentication information to requests. It requires an API key and a user name for authentication.

## Recording Operations

The session keeps track of pending operations using the `recorded_operations` attribute. You can enable or disable recording operations by setting the `record_operations` flag.

## Logging

The session uses the Python `logging` module for logging messages. You can access the logger using the `logger` attribute.

## Environment Variables

If certain parameters like `server_url`, `api_key`, or `api_user` are not specified during session initialization, the session will attempt to retrieve them from environment variables such as `FTRACK_SERVER`, `FTRACK_API_KEY`, and `FTRACK_API_USER`.

## Error Handling

The session handles errors such as missing required parameters by raising `TypeError` exceptions with informative error messages.

## Caching

The session uses a layered cache mechanism with a top-level `MemoryCache`. You can provide a custom cache implementation or use the default cache provided by the session.

## Event Hub

The session can automatically connect to the event hub for publishing and subscribing to events. You can control the event hub connection behavior using the `auto_connect_event_hub` parameter.

## Schema Caching

You can enable schema caching by specifying a folder path for storing the cache. This can help improve performance by caching schema information.

## Plugin Paths

You can specify a list of paths to search for plugins using the `plugin_paths` parameter. This allows you to extend the functionality of the ftrack API with custom plugins.

By following these steps, you can quickly set up a session and start interacting with an ftrack server using the API.
