Understanding Sessions
=======================

The `Session` class provides an isolated session for interaction with an ftrack server. When initializing a session, you can specify various parameters to customize its behavior:

- `server_url`: The URL of the ftrack server to connect to, including any port number.
- `api_key`: The API key to use for authentication.
- `api_user`: The username of the user in ftrack to record operations against.
- `auto_populate`: If set to True, accessing entity attributes will automatically fetch them from the server if they are not already available.
- `plugin_paths`: A list of paths to search for plugins.
- `cache`: An instance of a cache that will be used as the cache for the session.
- `cache_key_maker`: An instance of a key maker that will be used to generate keys for objects being stored in the cache.
- `auto_connect_event_hub`: If set to True, the embedded event hub will be automatically connected to the event server.
- `schema_cache_path`: Enable schema caching by setting this to a folder path.
- `plugin_arguments`: Optional mapping of keyword arguments to pass to plugin register functions upon discovery.

The session also provides functionality for recording operations, managing caches, and connecting to event hubs. It is essential for interacting with the ftrack server in a structured and controlled manner.
