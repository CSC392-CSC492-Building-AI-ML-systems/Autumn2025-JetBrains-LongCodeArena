Generate documentation for this module
=======================================

This module provides functionality for generating documentation for Alembic commands. It includes the following functions:

list_templates
-------------

This function lists the available templates for Alembic commands. It takes a :class:`.Config` object as a parameter and prints out the available templates along with their synopses.

init
----

The `init` function initializes a new scripts directory for Alembic commands. It takes parameters such as the target directory path, the migration environment template to use, and whether to write `__init__.py` files into the environment location.

revision
--------

The `revision` function creates a new revision file for Alembic commands. It allows specifying various options such as the revision message, whether to autogenerate the script from the database, and other revision-related settings.

Please refer to the function signatures and docstrings for detailed information on how to use these functions effectively.
