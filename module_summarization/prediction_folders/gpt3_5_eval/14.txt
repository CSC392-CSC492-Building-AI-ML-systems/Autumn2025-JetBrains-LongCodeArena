## Querying

The `ftrack_api.query` module provides functionality for constructing and executing queries against the ftrack server. Queries are used to retrieve specific data from the server based on specified criteria.

### Query Construction

Queries are constructed using the `Query` class, which allows you to specify conditions, filters, sorting, and other parameters to tailor the results to your needs.

### Query Execution

Once a query is constructed, it can be executed using the `Session.query` method. This method sends the query to the ftrack server and returns the results based on the specified criteria.

### Example

```python
# Construct a query to retrieve all tasks assigned to a specific user
query = ftrack_api.query.Query('Task where assignments any (user.username is "john.doe")')

# Execute the query
tasks = session.query(query)

for task in tasks:
    print(task['name'])
```

### Advanced Querying

The `ftrack_api.query` module also provides advanced querying capabilities such as joining multiple entities, using aggregation functions, and performing complex filtering operations to retrieve specific data sets.

### Query Language

Queries in ftrack API use a specific query language that allows you to express complex conditions and filters to retrieve the desired data efficiently. Familiarizing yourself with the query language syntax will help you construct effective queries to fetch the required information from the ftrack server.
