# Using Timers

To utilize timers in your code, you can make use of the `threading` module in Python. Timers allow you to schedule a function to run after a specified amount of time. Here is an example of how you can use timers:

1. Import the `threading` module:

```python
import threading
```

2. Define the function that you want to run after a certain delay:

```python
def my_timer_function():
    print("Timer function executed!")
```

3. Create a timer object with the desired delay in seconds and the function to execute:

```python
my_timer = threading.Timer(5, my_timer_function)
```

4. Start the timer:

```python
my_timer.start()
```

In this example, the `my_timer_function` will be executed after 5 seconds. You can adjust the delay as needed for your specific use case. Timers are useful for scheduling tasks to run in the background without blocking the main execution flow of your program.
