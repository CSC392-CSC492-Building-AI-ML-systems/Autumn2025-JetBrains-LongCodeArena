Biclustering
============

The Biclustering algorithm is a technique used for simultaneous clustering of rows and columns in a matrix. It aims to identify subgroups of rows and columns that exhibit similar patterns of values. This technique is particularly useful for analyzing data where both rows and columns have inherent relationships that need to be considered together.

Biclustering can be applied to various types of data, such as gene expression data, text data, and image data. By identifying biclusters, researchers can uncover hidden patterns and structures within the data that may not be apparent through traditional clustering methods.

The Biclustering algorithm works by iteratively identifying subsets of rows and columns that exhibit similar patterns, while allowing for variations in the values within these subsets. This flexibility enables the algorithm to capture complex relationships in the data that may not conform to strict clustering boundaries.

Overall, Biclustering is a powerful tool for exploring complex datasets and uncovering hidden structures that may provide valuable insights for further analysis and interpretation.
