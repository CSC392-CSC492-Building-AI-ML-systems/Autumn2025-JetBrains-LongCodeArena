Mixed GLM Module
================

The mixed GLM module provides Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models. Currently, only families without additional scale or shape parameters (such as binomial and Poisson) are supported. Two estimation approaches are available: Laplace approximation ('maximum a posteriori') and variational Bayes (mean field approximation to the posterior distribution).

Model Description
-----------------

In this implementation, all realizations of random effects are modeled to be mutually independent. The `exog_vc` matrix serves as the design matrix for the random effects, where each column corresponds to an independent realization of a random effect. These random effects have a mean of zero and an unknown standard deviation. The standard deviation parameters are constrained to be equal within subsets of the columns, specified through the `ident` parameter.

Sparse matrices are supported for `exog_vc`, and if a dense matrix is passed, it will be internally converted to a sparse matrix. The joint density of data and parameters factors into terms related to the response values, variance component parameters, prior distributions, and fixed effects.

Model Parameters
----------------

The posterior distribution includes fixed effects parameters (`fep`), random effects realizations (`vc`), and standard deviations of the random effects realizations (`vcp`). Random effects are modeled as independent Gaussian values, and the variance structure parameters are used to determine the distinct variance structure. The random effect standard deviation parameters (`vcp`) have log-normal prior distributions, while the prior for fixed effects parameters is Gaussian.
