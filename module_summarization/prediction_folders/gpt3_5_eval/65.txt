# Probability Calibration Tutorial

The `CalibratedClassifierCV` class in scikit-learn provides a way to calibrate predicted probabilities from a classifier using isotonic regression or logistic regression. This tutorial will guide you through the process of probability calibration using this class.

## Overview

Probability calibration is important when working with classifiers that output predicted probabilities. Calibrating these probabilities can improve the accuracy of `predict_proba` outputs and make the model more reliable.

The `CalibratedClassifierCV` class in scikit-learn allows you to calibrate the predicted probabilities of a classifier using cross-validation. It supports two calibration methods: 'sigmoid' (logistic regression) and 'isotonic' (non-parametric approach).

## Getting Started

To get started with probability calibration using `CalibratedClassifierCV`, you need to provide the following parameters:

- `estimator`: The classifier whose predicted probabilities you want to calibrate.
- `method`: The calibration method to use ('sigmoid' or 'isotonic').
- `cv`: The cross-validation strategy to use for calibration.
- `n_jobs`: Number of parallel jobs to run during calibration.
- `ensemble`: Whether to use an ensemble of calibrated classifiers.

## Calibration Process

The calibration process involves fitting a copy of the base estimator to the training subset and calibrating it using the testing subset for each cross-validation split. The predicted probabilities from these individual calibrated classifiers are then averaged to obtain the final output.

Alternatively, if `ensemble=False`, unbiased predictions are obtained using cross-validation, and the base estimator trained on all data is used for calibration.

## Usage

You can use the `CalibratedClassifierCV` class to calibrate already fitted classifiers by setting `cv="prefit"`. In this case, all provided data is used for calibration, and the user must ensure that the data for model fitting and calibration are disjoint.

## Conclusion

Probability calibration is a crucial step in improving the reliability of predicted probabilities from classifiers. By following this tutorial and utilizing the `CalibratedClassifierCV` class in scikit-learn, you can effectively calibrate the predicted probabilities of your classifier for more accurate results.
