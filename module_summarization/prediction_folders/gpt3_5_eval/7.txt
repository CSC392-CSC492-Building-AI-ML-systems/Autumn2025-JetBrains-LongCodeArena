# Using Lists

In the ftrack API, lists play a crucial role in managing and organizing data. Lists are used to store collections of items, allowing for easy access, iteration, and manipulation of the elements within them.

## Creating Lists

To create a list in Python, you can use square brackets `[]` and separate the elements with commas. For example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Accessing Elements

You can access elements in a list by their index. Indexing in Python starts at 0, so the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. For example:

```python
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
print(my_list[2])  # Output: 3
```

## Modifying Lists

Lists in Python are mutable, meaning you can change the elements they contain. You can modify elements by assigning new values to specific indexes or using list methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, and `pop()`.

```python
my_list[1] = 10  # Update the second element
my_list.append(6)  # Add a new element to the end of the list
my_list.remove(3)  # Remove a specific element
```

## Iterating Over Lists

You can iterate over the elements of a list using loops like `for` or `while`. This allows you to perform operations on each item in the list sequentially.

```python
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python. They allow you to generate new lists by applying an expression to each item in an existing list or iterable.

```python
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in my_list]
```

## Slicing Lists

Slicing allows you to extract a subset of elements from a list. You can specify a start index, end index, and step size to create a new list containing the selected elements.

```python
subset = my_list[1:4]  # Get elements from index 1 to 3
```

## Working with Nested Lists

Lists can also contain other lists, creating nested structures. This is useful for representing multi-dimensional data or hierarchical relationships.

```python
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
```

By understanding how to use lists effectively, you can efficiently manage and manipulate data in your ftrack API applications.
