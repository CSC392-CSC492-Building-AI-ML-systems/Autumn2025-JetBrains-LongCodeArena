# Publishing for Web Review

To publish content for web review using the ftrack API, you can utilize the `Session` class provided by the API. The `Session` class allows you to interact with an ftrack server in an isolated manner.

## Initializing a Session

To initialize a session, you need to provide the following parameters:

- `server_url`: The URL of the ftrack server to connect to.
- `api_key`: The API key for authentication.
- `api_user`: The username of the user in ftrack to record operations against.
- `auto_populate`: Flag to automatically fetch entity attributes from the server if not already fetched.
- `plugin_paths`: List of paths to search for plugins.
- `cache`: Cache instance to be used for the session.
- `cache_key_maker`: Key maker instance to generate keys for objects in the cache.
- `auto_connect_event_hub`: Flag to automatically connect to the event server for publishing and subscribing to events.
- `schema_cache_path`: Folder path for schema caching.
- `plugin_arguments`: Optional mapping of keyword arguments to pass to plugin register functions.

## Session Authentication

The `SessionAuthentication` class can be used to attach ftrack session authentication information to requests. It requires the `api_key` and `api_user` during initialization and modifies the request headers accordingly.

## Publishing Operations

The `Session` class provides functionality to record operations and interact with the ftrack server. You can record operations, manage caches, and connect to the event hub for publishing and subscribing to events.

## Schema Caching

Schema caching can be enabled by setting the `schema_cache_path` parameter to a folder path. This allows for efficient caching of schema data.

By utilizing the ftrack API and the `Session` class, you can easily publish content for web review and interact with the ftrack server in a structured and efficient manner.
