Scheme to Verify FITS Data
==========================

This module provides a scheme for verifying FITS data. The verification process allows for different options to handle errors and fixable issues. The main classes and methods involved in the verification process are described below.

Classes
-------

VerifyError
    Exception class for verification errors.

VerifyWarning
    Warning class for verification warnings.

_NotifierMixin
    Mixin class that provides services for registering listeners to changes on objects.

_ErrList
    Verification errors list class that constructs a nested list structure for error messages generated during verifications.

Methods
-------

_Verify.run_option(option="warn", err_text="", fix_text="Fixed.", fix=None, fixable=True)
    Execute the verification with the selected option, handling errors and fixable issues.

_Verify.verify(option="warn")
    Verify all values in the instance based on the specified option. Available options include "fix", "silentfix", "ignore", "warn", and "exception".

_ErrList.iter_lines(filter=None, shift=0)
    Iterate through the nested structure of error messages, providing strings with appropriate indentations for each level of the structure.

NotifierMixin
-------------

The `NotifierMixin` class provides a mechanism for objects to register listeners for changes. It includes methods for adding listeners and notifying them of changes.

Examples
--------

Below is an example of how to use the `NotifierMixin` class:

```python
class Widget(NotifierMixin):
    state = 1
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def update_state(self):
        self.state += 1
```

Note: The `astropy.io.fits` module uses zero-based indexing.
