=======================================

The `BaseUser` module provides a basic user model with authentication support. It includes functionality for user authentication, password hashing, password validation, and user login. Below is an overview of the key features and methods provided by the `BaseUser` module:

- **User Model Fields**:
  - `id`: A serial column representing the user ID.
  - `username`: A varchar column for storing the username.
  - `password`: A secret column for storing the hashed password.
  - `first_name`: A varchar column for storing the user's first name.
  - `last_name`: A varchar column for storing the user's last name.
  - `email`: A varchar column for storing the user's email address.
  - `active`: A boolean column indicating whether the user is active.
  - `admin`: A boolean column indicating whether the user is an admin.
  - `superuser`: A boolean column indicating whether the user is a superuser.
  - `last_login`: A timestamp column indicating the user's last login time.

- **Password Hashing**:
  - The module provides methods for hashing passwords using the `pbkdf2_sha256` algorithm with a customizable number of iterations.
  - Passwords are hashed before being stored in the database to ensure security.

- **User Authentication**:
  - The module includes methods for updating a user's password, validating passwords, and logging in users.
  - Password validation checks for password length and ensures that passwords are not already hashed.

- **User Login**:
  - The `login` method allows users to log in by verifying their username and password against stored credentials.
  - Successful logins update the `last_login` timestamp in the database.

- **Additional Functionality**:
  - The module provides utility methods for generating salts, splitting stored passwords, and converting table rows to readable strings.

Overall, the `BaseUser` module offers a comprehensive set of features for managing user authentication and access control within a Piccolo application. Developers can leverage these functionalities to create secure user authentication systems with ease.
