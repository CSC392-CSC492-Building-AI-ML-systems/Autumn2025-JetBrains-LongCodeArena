# Fleur Input/Output Parsers Documentation

The Fleur input/output parsers in the Masci-tools package provide functions to extract distinct parts of the Fleur XML files for easy versioning and reuse.

## Function: `get_fleur_modes`

This function is used to determine the calculation modes of Fleur for a given XML file. Calculation modes are aspects that can alter the produced files or output in the `out.xml` files. The following modes are inspected:

- `jspin`: Number of spins considered in the calculation
- `noco`: Whether the calculation is non-collinear
- `soc`: Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling
- `relax`: Whether the calculation is a structure relaxation
- `spex`: Special mode for GW/Spex calculations
- `force_theorem`: Whether a Force theorem calculation is performed
- `film`: Whether the structure is a film system
- `ldau`: Inclusion of LDA+U
- `dos`: Density of states calculation
- `band`: Bandstructure calculation
- `bz_integration`: Method of integration over the Brillouin-Zone

## Function: `get_nkpts`

This function retrieves the number of kpoints that will be used in the calculation specified in the given Fleur XML file. For file versions before Max5, only `kPointList` or `kPointCount` tags will work. However, for `kPointCount`, there is no guarantee that it will always correspond to the number of kpoints. A warning is issued in such cases.

Please refer to the source code for more detailed information on the implementation of these functions.
