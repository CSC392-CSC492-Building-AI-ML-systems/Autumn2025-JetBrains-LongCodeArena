To use metadata in the ftrack API, you can create an isolated session by initializing a `Session` object. The `Session` class provides various parameters for configuration, such as `server_url`, `api_key`, `api_user`, `auto_populate`, `plugin_paths`, `cache`, `cache_key_maker`, `auto_connect_event_hub`, `schema_cache_path`, and `plugin_arguments`.

When initializing a `Session`, you need to provide the necessary authentication information like the `server_url`, `api_key`, and `api_user`. If not specified, the `api_key` can be retrieved from the `FTRACK_API_KEY` environment variable, and the `api_user` can be retrieved from the `FTRACK_API_USER` environment variable or the system's standard environment variables used by Python's `getpass` module.

By default, the `auto_populate` parameter is set to True, which means that accessing entity attributes will automatically fetch them from the server if they are not already available. You can also specify paths to search for plugins using the `plugin_paths` parameter.

Additionally, you can configure caching behavior by providing a cache instance or a callable that returns a suitable cache. The `auto_connect_event_hub` parameter allows you to automatically connect to the event server for publishing and subscribing to events. Schema caching can be enabled by setting the `schema_cache_path` parameter to a folder path.

The `Session` class also provides a `recorded_operations` attribute to track pending operations and a `record_operations` flag to control operation recording. Make sure to handle exceptions and ensure that the required parameters are provided to initialize a session successfully.
