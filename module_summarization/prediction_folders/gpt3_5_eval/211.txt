Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models
=======================================

Bayesian Inference for Generalized Linear Mixed Models
------------------------------------------------------

Currently, this implementation supports families without additional scale or shape parameters, such as binomial and Poisson distributions. Two estimation approaches are available: Laplace approximation ('maximum a posteriori') and variational Bayes (mean field approximation to the posterior distribution). In this implementation, all realizations of random effects are assumed to be mutually independent.

Model and Parameterization
--------------------------

The joint density of data and parameters factors as:

.. math::

    p(y | vc, fep) p(vc | vcp) p(vcp) p(fe)

The terms :math:`p(vcp)` and :math:`p(fe)` represent prior distributions, assumed to be Gaussian. The random effects distribution :math:`p(vc | vcp)` is modeled as independent Gaussian, with random effect realizations being independent within and between values of the `ident` array. The model :math:`p(y | vc, fep)` depends on the specific Generalized Linear Model (GLM) being fit.

Initialization
--------------

The class provides methods for fitting a generalized linear mixed model using Bayesian methods. The two main fitting approaches are the Laplace approximation to the posterior distribution (`fit_map`) and a variational Bayes approximation to the posterior (`fit_vb`). The class takes various parameters, including the response values, covariates for the fixed effects, covariates for the random effects, prior standard deviations for variance component parameters, and the GLM family.

Notes
-----

- The posterior distribution includes fixed effects parameters (fep), random effects realizations (vc), and standard deviations of the random effects realizations (vcp).
- Random effects are modeled as independent Gaussian values, with each column of `exog_vc` representing a distinct realized random effect.
- The random effect standard deviation parameters (`vcp`) have log-normal prior distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation `vcp_p`.
- The prior for fixed effects parameters is Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation `fe_p`.
