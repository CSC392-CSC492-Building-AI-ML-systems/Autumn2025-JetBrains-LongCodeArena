# Fitting SESANS Data

The `sesans_fitting.rst` file contains documentation for fitting SESANS data using the provided code. The code includes functions for listing parameters used in models, finding all parameters in models, and printing parameters along with the models they occur in. The main program allows users to list parameters across all models with optional verbose mode to display models using specific arguments.

The code also includes functions for converting between latitude-longitude and Guyou map coordinates using special functions like ellipticJ and ellipticF. These functions handle the conversion process efficiently and accurately.

The documentation provides detailed information on how to utilize the code for fitting SESANS data, listing parameters, and converting coordinates. Users can refer to this documentation for guidance on using the code effectively for their SESANS data analysis needs.
