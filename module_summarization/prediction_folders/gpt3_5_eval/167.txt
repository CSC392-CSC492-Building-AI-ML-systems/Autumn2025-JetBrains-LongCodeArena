Library Conventions
=====================

This library follows certain conventions for organizing code and documentation to maintain consistency and clarity. Below are the key conventions used in this library:

File Structure
--------------

- Each module is contained in a separate Python file with a meaningful name related to its functionality.
- The module should start with a brief description enclosed in triple double quotes (`"""`) explaining its purpose and contents.
- Copyright information and author details should be included at the beginning of the file.
- Import statements should be placed at the beginning of the file, following the module docstring.
- Functions and classes within the module should be organized logically with appropriate comments and docstrings.

Function Naming
----------------

- Function names should be descriptive and follow the snake_case naming convention.
- Public functions should be included in the `__all__` list at the beginning of the module.
- Docstrings should be provided for each function, describing its purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples.

Parameter Naming
-----------------

- Parameters in function signatures should be named clearly and concisely to indicate their purpose.
- Default parameter values should be specified where applicable.
- Parameter names should follow the snake_case naming convention.

Code Documentation
-------------------

- Docstrings should follow the NumPy/SciPy documentation style.
- Each module, class, function, and method should have a docstring explaining its purpose and usage.
- Examples of how to use functions should be provided in the docstrings using the `Examples` section.
- Notes and additional information should be included where necessary to clarify behavior or usage.

Conventions for Optimal Control Module
--------------------------------------

The `optimal` module in this library provides support for optimization-based controllers for nonlinear systems with state and input constraints. Here are the conventions specific to this module:

- The `OptimalControlProblem` class is used to describe a finite horizon, optimal control problem.
- The class holds information about the system dynamics, cost function, and constraints required to specify an optimal control problem.
- Parameters for the `OptimalControlProblem` class should be provided as described in the class documentation.

By following these conventions, the library maintains consistency in code structure, naming, and documentation, making it easier for users to understand and work with the provided functionality.
