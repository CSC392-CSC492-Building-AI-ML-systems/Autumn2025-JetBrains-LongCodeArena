# Array Best Practices

## Dispatch in dask.array

The `Dispatch` class in `dask.array` provides a mechanism for dispatching functions based on a specified key. Some of the key functions available for dispatch include:
- `concatenate`
- `tensordot`
- `einsum`
- `empty`
- `divide`
- `percentile`
- `numel`
- `nannumel`
- `to_numpy_dispatch`
- `to_cupy_dispatch`

## Masked Array Operations

The code snippet also includes various functions related to masked array operations, such as:
- `filled`
- `masked_greater`
- `masked_greater_equal`
- `masked_less`
- `masked_less_equal`
- `masked_not_equal`
- `masked_equal`
- `masked_invalid`
- `masked_inside`
- `masked_outside`
- `masked_where`
- `masked_values`
- `fix_invalid`
- `getdata`
- `getmaskarray`

These functions provide functionalities for working with masked arrays in `dask.array`, allowing for operations like masking values, fixing invalid entries, and retrieving data and mask arrays.

These best practices aim to enhance the efficiency and usability of array operations within the `dask.array` framework.
