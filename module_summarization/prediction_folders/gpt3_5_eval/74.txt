# Random Projection Module

The Random Projection module provides transformers for reducing the dimensionality of data using random projections. Random Projections offer a simple and computationally efficient method to decrease data dimensionality by sacrificing a controlled amount of accuracy for faster processing times and smaller model sizes.

## Theory Behind Random Projection

The efficiency of random projection is supported by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which is a result in mathematics concerning low-distortion embeddings of points from high-dimensional spaces into low-dimensional Euclidean space. The lemma states that a small set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension while preserving distances between the points.

## Functions

### `johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim(n_samples, *, eps=0.1)`

This function calculates the minimum number of components required to guarantee an epsilon-embedding with good probability. The epsilon-embedding ensures that the distance between two points is preserved within a factor of (1 +- eps) in a Euclidean space. The function is based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma.

- **Parameters:**
  - `n_samples`: int or array-like of int
  - `eps`: float or array-like of shape (n_components,), dtype=float, default=0.1

- **Returns:**
  - `n_components`: int or ndarray of int

### `_check_density(density, n_features)`

This function factorizes the density check according to Li et al., ensuring that the density value is within the expected range.

- **Parameters:**
  - `density`: float
  - `n_features`: int

### `_check_input_size(n_components, n_features)`

This function checks the input size for random matrix generation, ensuring that both `n_components` and `n_features` are strictly positive.

- **Parameters:**
  - `n_components`: int
  - `n_features`: int

### `_gaussian_random_matrix(n_components, n_features, random_state=None)`

This function generates a dense Gaussian random matrix with components drawn from N(0, 1.0 / n_components).

- **Parameters:**
  - `n_components`: int
  - `n_features`: int
  - `random_state`: int, RandomState instance, default=None
