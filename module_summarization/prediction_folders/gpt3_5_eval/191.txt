Validation Curves: Plotting Scores to Evaluate Models
=====================================================

The validation curve visualization provides a way to evaluate the performance of machine learning models by plotting scores against varying hyperparameters. This can help in understanding how changing hyperparameters impacts the model's performance and can aid in tuning the model for better results.

LearningCurveDisplay Class
---------------------------

The `LearningCurveDisplay` class is a visualization tool for plotting learning curves, which show how the model's performance changes with varying training set sizes. It is recommended to use the `from_estimator` method to create an instance of `LearningCurveDisplay`. The class stores the following parameters as attributes:

- `train_sizes`: Array of training set sizes used to generate the learning curve.
- `train_scores`: Array of scores on the training sets.
- `test_scores`: Array of scores on the test set.
- `score_name`: Name of the score used in the learning curve.

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~

- `ax_`: Matplotlib Axes object containing the learning curve plot.
- `figure_`: Matplotlib Figure object containing the learning curve.
- `errorbar_`: List of Matplotlib Artist objects representing error bars when `std_display_style` is set to "errorbar".
- `lines_`: List of Matplotlib Artist objects representing mean train and test scores when `std_display_style` is set to "fill_between".
- `fill_between_`: List of Matplotlib Artist objects representing the filled area between the standard deviations of scores when `std_display_style` is set to "fill_between".

For more information on how to use the `LearningCurveDisplay` class and examples of its usage, refer to the User Guide on visualizations and the detailed documentation on learning curve visualization.
