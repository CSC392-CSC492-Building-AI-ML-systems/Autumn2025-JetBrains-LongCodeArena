Nearest Neighbors
==================

The Nearest Neighbors module provides functionality for efficient nearest neighbor search using Ball Trees. The Ball Tree data structure is specialized for nearest neighbor queries and is optimized for high-dimensional data.

Classes
-------

- `BallTree`: A generic Ball Tree class for nearest neighbor search.
- `BallTree64`: A Ball Tree implementation for 64-bit floating point data.
- `BallTree32`: A Ball Tree implementation for 32-bit floating point data.

Metrics
-------

The following distance metrics are supported for nearest neighbor search:

- BrayCurtisDistance
- CanberraDistance
- ChebyshevDistance
- DiceDistance
- EuclideanDistance
- HammingDistance
- HaversineDistance
- JaccardDistance
- MahalanobisDistance
- ManhattanDistance
- MinkowskiDistance
- PyFuncDistance
- RogersTanimotoDistance
- RussellRaoDistance
- SEuclideanDistance
- SokalMichenerDistance
- SokalSneathDistance
- WMinkowskiDistance

Functions
---------

The module provides specialized functions for the Ball Tree data structure, including:

- `allocate_data`: Allocate arrays needed for the Ball Tree.
- `init_node`: Initialize a node for the dataset stored in the Ball Tree.
- `min_dist`: Compute the minimum distance between a point and a node in the Ball Tree.
- `max_dist`: Compute the maximum distance between a point and a node in the Ball Tree.
- `min_max_dist`: Compute both the minimum and maximum distances between a point and a node in the Ball Tree.
