Generate documentation for auto_augment module
==============================================

The ``auto_augment`` module provides functions for applying predefined policies from the AutoAugment paper to batches of samples. These policies are designed to enhance the training data by applying various augmentations.

Functions
---------

.. autofunction:: auto_augment.auto_augment

    Applies one of the predefined policies from the AutoAugment paper to the provided batch of samples.

.. autofunction:: auto_augment.auto_augment_image_net

    Applies the `image_net_policy` in AutoAugment fashion to the provided batch of samples.

Parameters
----------

The functions in this module accept the following parameters:

- ``data``: A batch of samples to be processed.
- ``policy_name``: The name of the predefined policy to be applied.
- ``shape``: The size (height and width) of the image or frames in the video sequence.
- ``fill_value``: A value to be used as padding for images/frames transformed with warp_affine ops.
- ``interp_type``: Interpolation method used by the warp_affine ops.
- ``max_translate_abs``: Specifies the maximal shift in the translation augmentation.
- ``max_translate_rel``: Specifies the maximal shift as a fraction of image shape in the translation augmentations.
- ``seed``: Seed to be used to randomly sample operations.

Returns
-------

The functions return a batch of transformed samples.

For more details on each function and its usage, refer to the function documentation.

For additional information on the predefined policies and their implementations, please refer to the AutoAugment paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501).
