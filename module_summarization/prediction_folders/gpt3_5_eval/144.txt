# Scheduling Policies in Dask's Distributed Scheduler

Dask's distributed scheduler employs various policies to select the preference of tasks and workers. These policies play a crucial role in determining how tasks are assigned to workers and how workers are utilized within the distributed computing environment. Understanding these scheduling policies is essential for optimizing the performance and resource utilization of Dask applications.

## Task Scheduling Policies

### Task State States
The scheduler maintains different states for tasks, including:
- **Released**: Task has been released for execution.
- **Waiting**: Task is waiting for its dependencies to be resolved.
- **No Worker**: Task has no worker assigned for execution.
- **Queued**: Task is in the queue waiting for execution.
- **Processing**: Task is currently being processed.
- **Memory**: Task is stored in memory.
- **Erred**: Task encountered an error during execution.
- **Forgotten**: Task has been forgotten and is no longer tracked.

### Task Recommendations
The scheduler generates recommendations for task execution based on their states. These recommendations dictate how tasks should be processed and assigned to workers.

## Worker Scheduling Policies

### Client State
The scheduler maintains information about clients, including:
- **Client Key**: Unique identifier for the client.
- **Wants What**: Set of tasks the client wants to keep in memory.
- **Last Seen**: Timestamp of the last heartbeat received from the client.
- **Versions**: Versions of software running on the client.

### Default Extensions
The scheduler supports various extensions for managing worker behavior, such as:
- **Locks**: Extension for managing locks.
- **Multi-Locks**: Extension for handling multiple locks.
- **Publish**: Extension for publishing data.
- **Replay Tasks**: Scheduler for replaying tasks.
- **Queues**: Extension for managing task queues.
- **Variables**: Extension for handling variables.
- **PubSub**: Extension for publish-subscribe communication.
- **Semaphores**: Extension for managing semaphores.
- **Events**: Extension for handling events.
- **Active Memory Manager**: Extension for managing memory.
- **Memory Sampler**: Extension for sampling memory usage.
- **Shuffle**: Plugin for shuffling data.
- **Spans**: Extension for managing spans.
- **Work Stealing**: Mechanism for stealing work from other workers.

By understanding and configuring these scheduling policies, users can optimize task execution, resource allocation, and overall performance of Dask's distributed scheduler.
