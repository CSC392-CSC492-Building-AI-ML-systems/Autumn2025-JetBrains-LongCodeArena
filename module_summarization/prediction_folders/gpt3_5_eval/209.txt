Analyzing a collection of text documents

The `sklearn.feature_extraction.text` submodule provides utilities to build feature vectors from text documents. This submodule includes various tools for text analysis and processing, such as vectorizers and transformers.

Key components of text analysis in scikit-learn include:

- `HashingVectorizer`: A vectorizer that converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token occurrences.
- `CountVectorizer`: A vectorizer that converts a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts.
- `TfidfTransformer`: A transformer that converts a matrix of token counts into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
- `TfidfVectorizer`: A vectorizer that combines the functionality of `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer` in a single step.

Additionally, the submodule provides functions for text preprocessing, such as:

- `strip_accents_ascii`: Removes accentuated Unicode symbols and transforms them into ASCII characters.
- `strip_accents_unicode`: Transforms accentuated Unicode symbols into their simple counterparts.
- `strip_tags`: Strips HTML/XML tags from text strings.

Text preprocessing steps, such as lowercasing, accent handling, and tokenization, can be chained together using the `_preprocess` and `_analyze` functions provided in the submodule.

By leveraging these tools and functions, users can efficiently analyze and process collections of text documents for various natural language processing tasks.
