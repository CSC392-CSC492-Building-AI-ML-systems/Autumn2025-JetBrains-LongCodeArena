# Storage Driver

The Storage driver module contains classes that store arbitrary NetCDF (or other) options and describe how to handle them. It provides a versatile and dynamic class, `StorageInterfaceDirVar`, which gives structure to the variables stored on disk by representing them as methods of the `StorageInterface` and other instances of itself.

The `StorageInterfaceDirVar` class is designed to handle top-level I/O operations on the file itself. It allows for creating new variables and folders by simply trying to use them as properties of the class. Data stored and read is not kept in memory; instead, the class passes the data onto the writer or tells the fetcher to read from disk on demand.

This class provides user functions such as `write`, `append`, and `read` to store and read data from disk. The `write` method is used to write data to a variable, either as a new value or at a specific index of an appendable variable. The `append` method is used to write data to a variable whose size changes every time the function is called. The `read` method is used to read the variable and its data from disk.

It is important to note that the `StorageInterfaceDirVar` class should not be used as its own object and should never be invoked by itself. Examples of how to use this class can be found in the `StorageInterface` main class.

**TODO:** Move the `StorageInterfaceDirVar` class as an internal class of `StorageInterface` (NOT as a subclass).
