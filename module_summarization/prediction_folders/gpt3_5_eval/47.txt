Contingency Tables Module Documentation
=======================================

This module provides methods for analyzing two-way contingency tables, which are frequency tables for observations cross-classified with respect to two categorical variables. The main classes in this module are:

- `Table`: Implements methods that can be applied to any two-way contingency table.
- `SquareTable`: Implements methods that can be applied to a square two-way contingency table.
- `Table2x2`: Implements methods that can be applied to a 2x2 contingency table.
- `StratifiedTable`: Implements methods that can be applied to a collection of 2x2 contingency tables.

Additionally, this module contains functions for conducting McNemar's test and Cochran's q test. The inference procedures used in this module assume that the observed units are independent and identically distributed.

Classes
-------

Table
^^^^^

    A two-way contingency table.

    Parameters
    ----------
    table : array_like
        A contingency table.
    shift_zeros : boolean
        If True and any cell count is zero, add 0.5 to all values in the table.

    Attributes
    ----------
    table_orig : array_like
        The original table is cached as `table_orig`.

    Methods
    -------

    - `from_data`: Construct a Table object from data.
    - `test_nominal_association`: Assess independence for nominal factors.
    - `test_ordinal_association`: Assess independence between two ordinal variables.
