Kernels for Gaussian process regression and classification
==========================================================

The kernels in this module allow kernel-engineering, i.e., they can be combined via the "+" and "*" operators or be exponentiated with a scalar via "**". These sum and product expressions can also contain scalar values, which are automatically converted to a constant kernel.

All kernels allow (analytic) gradient-based hyperparameter optimization. The space of hyperparameters can be specified by giving lower and upper boundaries for the value of each hyperparameter (the search space is thus rectangular). Instead of specifying bounds, hyperparameters can also be declared to be "fixed", which causes these hyperparameters to be excluded from optimization.

Hyperparameter
--------------

A kernel hyperparameter's specification in the form of a namedtuple.

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

- **name** (*str*): The name of the hyperparameter. Note that a kernel using a hyperparameter with name "x" must have the attributes self.x and self.x_bounds.
- **value_type** (*str*): The type of the hyperparameter. Currently, only "numeric" hyperparameters are supported.
- **bounds** (*pair of floats >= 0 or "fixed"*): The lower and upper bound on the parameter. If n_elements > 1, a pair of 1d array with n_elements each may be given alternatively. If the string "fixed" is passed as bounds, the hyperparameter's value cannot be changed.
- **n_elements** (*int, default=1*): The number of elements of the hyperparameter value. Defaults to 1, which corresponds to a scalar hyperparameter. n_elements > 1 corresponds to a hyperparameter which is vector-valued, such as, e.g., anisotropic length-scales.
- **fixed** (*bool, default=None*): Whether the value of this hyperparameter is fixed, i.e., cannot be changed during hyperparameter tuning. If None is passed, the "fixed" is derived based on the given bounds.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

```python
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import ConstantKernel
from sklearn.datasets import make_friedman2
from sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessRegressor
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Hyperparameter

X, y = make_friedman2(n_samples=50, noise=0, random_state=0)
kernel = ConstantKernel(constant_value=1.0, constant_value_bounds=(0.0, 10.0))

# Access each hyperparameter
for hyperparameter in kernel.hyperparameters:
    print(hyperparameter)

params = kernel.get_params()
for key in sorted(params):
    print(f"{key} : {params[key]}")
```

Kernel
------

Base class for all kernels.

```python
class Kernel(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Base class for all kernels."""
```
```
