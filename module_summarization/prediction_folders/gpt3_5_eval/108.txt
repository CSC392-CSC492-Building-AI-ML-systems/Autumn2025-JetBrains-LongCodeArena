# Polynomial Factorization Routines

The code provided contains polynomial factorization routines in characteristic zero. These routines are designed to factorize multivariate polynomials over algebraic number fields and in the ring of integers. The factorization methods include trial division, Zassenhaus algorithm, and Enhanced Extended Zassenhaus (EEZ) algorithm.

## Factorization Methods

### `_trial_division(self, f, factors)`
- This method performs trial division on a polynomial `f` using a list of factors.
- It returns the factors of `f` along with their multiplicities in a sorted manner.

### `_aa_factor_trager(self, f)`
- Factorizes multivariate polynomials over algebraic number fields.
- It decomposes the input polynomial into irreducible factors over the given domain.
- The factors are transformed using a specific method before returning the result.

### `_zz_factor(self, f)`
- Factorizes non-square-free polynomials in `Z[X]` (ring of integers).
- Utilizes the Zassenhaus or Enhanced Extended Zassenhaus algorithm for factorization.
- Trial division is employed to determine the multiplicities of the factors.

### `_zz_mignotte_bound(self, f)`
- Calculates the Mignotte bound for multivariate polynomials in `Z[X]`.
- The bound is based on the maximum norm, leading coefficient, and degrees of the polynomial.

### `_zz_zassenhaus(self, f)`
- Factors a primitive square-free polynomial in `Z[x]` using the Zassenhaus algorithm.
- Involves selecting prime numbers and lifting factors to obtain the final factorization.
