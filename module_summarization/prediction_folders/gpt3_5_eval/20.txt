w_direct
========

The ``w_direct`` command is used to calculate state-to-state kinetics by tracing trajectories in a WESTPA simulation. This command is essential for converting flux data into average rates, fluxes, and populations with confidence intervals.

Usage
-----

``w_direct`` is the main command used for state-to-state kinetics calculations. It requires a bin assignment file (usually named "assign.h5") that includes trajectory labeling. This file is generated using the ``w_assign`` command.

Output Format
-------------

The output file generated by ``w_direct`` (by default named "direct.h5") contains the following datasets:

- ``/conditional_fluxes``: Macrostate-to-macrostate fluxes, not normalized by the population of the initial macrostate.
- ``/conditional_arrivals``: Number of trajectories arriving at a state given that they departed from another state.
- ``/total_fluxes``: Total flux into a given macrostate.
- ``/arrivals``: Number of trajectories arriving at a given state.
- ``/duration_count``: Number of event durations recorded in each iteration.
- ``/durations``: Event durations for transition events, including initial state, final state, duration, and weight of trajectory at the end of the transition.

Note that the state-to-state fluxes in the output file are not normalized by the initial macrostate population and require further processing to be used as rates. The ``w_direct kinetics`` command is used for this normalization while considering statistical fluctuation and correlation.

Command-line Options
--------------------

The ``w_direct`` command supports various command-line options for customization and control over the kinetics calculations. These options allow users to specify input files, output files, and other parameters necessary for the calculations.

For more detailed information on the options available with the ``w_direct`` command, refer to the command's help documentation.

For additional information on using the ``w_direct kinetics`` command for normalization and processing of state-to-state fluxes, refer to the respective help documentation.

``w_direct`` is a powerful tool for analyzing state-to-state kinetics in WESTPA simulations and is a crucial step in understanding the dynamics of complex systems.
