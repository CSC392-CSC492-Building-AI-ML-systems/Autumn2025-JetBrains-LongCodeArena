# Generate description to this module

This module implements the Multiple Imputation through Chained Equations (MICE) approach for handling missing data in statistical data analyses. The MICE procedure involves several steps, including imputing missing values based on observed values, fitting imputation models using regression, and combining results to produce point estimates and standard errors for analysis models.

The imputations are based on specified imputation models using regression relationships. Two main classes are provided in the module: 'MICEData' for producing imputed data sets and 'MICE' for running multiple imputation, fitting analysis models, and combining results. Various plotting procedures are available for visualizing imputation results and missing data patterns.

The module also introduces the concept of perturbation methods for setting parameter estimates in imputation models, such as 'gaussian' and 'boot'. References to relevant literature are included for further reading on multiple imputation techniques.

Overall, this module offers a comprehensive framework for handling missing data through the MICE approach, providing flexibility in specifying imputation models and facilitating the analysis of imputed data sets.
