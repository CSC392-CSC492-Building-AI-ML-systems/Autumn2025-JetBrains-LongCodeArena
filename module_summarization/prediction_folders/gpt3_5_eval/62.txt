# Generate documentation for this module

The `visitors.py` module provides a visitor/traversal interface and library functions for SQLAlchemy. It includes classes and functions for traversing and visiting different elements within SQLAlchemy objects.

## Classes and Functions

- `iterate`: A function for iterating over elements.
- `traverse_using`: A function for traversing elements using a specific visitor.
- `traverse`: A function for generic traversal of elements.
- `cloned_traverse`: A function for traversing cloned elements.
- `replacement_traverse`: A function for traversing elements with replacements.
- `Visitable`: A base class for visitable objects.
- `ExternalTraversal`: An enumeration defining visitor symbols for external traversal.
- `InternalTraversal`: An enumeration defining visitor symbols for internal traversal.
- `anon_map`: A utility function for mapping anonymous elements.

## `Visitable` Class

The `Visitable` class is used to implement the SQL compiler dispatch functions. It serves as the base class for visitable objects and is essential for implementing traversal mechanisms within SQLAlchemy. The class provides methods for generating compiler dispatch functions and handling visitation of elements.

## `InternalTraversal` Enum

The `InternalTraversal` enum defines visitor symbols used for internal traversal. It is used to specify different types of traversal methods for internal elements within SQLAlchemy objects. The enum includes symbols for visiting cache keys, clause elements, column collections, and more. Subclasses can utilize the symbols to implement traversal methods automatically.

## Additional Information

- The module includes type hints for better code readability and type checking.
- Various utility functions and imports are provided for efficient traversal and handling of elements.
- The module is part of SQLAlchemy and is released under the MIT License.

This documentation provides an overview of the visitor/traversal interface and key functions available in the `visitors.py` module. Developers can leverage these functionalities to traverse and visit elements within SQLAlchemy objects effectively.
