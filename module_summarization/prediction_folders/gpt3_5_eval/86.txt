# PostgresEngine Module

The `PostgresEngine` module provides functionality to connect to PostgreSQL databases using Piccolo.

## Classes

### AsyncBatch

- **Description**: Represents a batch of queries to be executed asynchronously.
- **Attributes**:
  - `connection`: The connection to the database.
  - `query`: The query to be executed.
  - `batch_size`: The size of the batch.
- **Methods**:
  - `next()`: Asynchronously fetches the next set of results.
  - `__aiter__()`: Asynchronous iterator.
  - `__anext__()`: Asynchronously fetches the next set of results.
  - `__aenter__()`: Asynchronous context manager for entering a transaction.
  - `__aexit__()`: Asynchronous context manager for exiting a transaction.

### Atomic

- **Description**: Allows building up a transaction programmatically by adding queries.
- **Methods**:
  - `add()`: Adds queries to the transaction.
  - `run()`: Asynchronously runs the transaction.
  - `run_sync()`: Synchronously runs the transaction.

### Savepoint

- **Description**: Represents a savepoint within a transaction.
- **Methods**:
  - `rollback_to()`: Asynchronously rolls back to the savepoint.
  - `release()`: Asynchronously releases the savepoint.

### PostgresTransaction

- **Description**: Used for wrapping queries in a transaction using a context manager.
- **Methods**:
  - `__aenter__()`: Asynchronous context manager for entering a transaction.
  - `__aexit__()`: Asynchronous context manager for exiting a transaction.
  - `rollback_to()`: Asynchronously rolls back to a savepoint.
  - `savepoint()`: Asynchronously creates a savepoint within the transaction.

### PostgresEngine

- **Description**: Used to connect to PostgreSQL databases.
- **Inherits**: `Engine`
- **Methods**:
  - `__init__()`: Initializes the PostgresEngine.
  - `get_connection()`: Asynchronously acquires a connection to the database.
  - `begin()`: Asynchronously starts a transaction.
  - `commit()`: Asynchronously commits a transaction.
  - `rollback()`: Asynchronously rolls back a transaction.
  - `rollback_to()`: Asynchronously rolls back to a savepoint.
  - `get_savepoint_id()`: Gets the ID for the next savepoint.
  - `savepoint()`: Asynchronously creates a savepoint within the transaction.
