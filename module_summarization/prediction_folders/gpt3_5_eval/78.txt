=======================================

The FileNode module provides a file interface for using inside of PyTables database files. Use the `new_node()` function to create a brand new file node which can be read and written as any ordinary Python file. Use the `open_node()` function to open an existing node for read-only or read-write access. Read access is always available. Write access (enabled on new files and files opened with mode 'a+') only allows appending data to a file node. Currently, only binary I/O is supported.

This module has been completely rewritten in version 3.0 to be fully compliant with the interfaces defined in the `io` module.

Classes
-------

RawPyTablesIO
    Base class for raw binary I/O on HDF5 files using PyTables.

Attributes
----------

NodeType
    Value for NODE_TYPE node system attribute.

NodeTypeVersions
    Supported values for NODE_TYPE_VERSION node system attribute.

Methods
-------

`mode`
    Returns the file mode.

`tell()`
    Returns the current stream position.

`seek(pos, whence=0)`
    Change the stream position to byte offset offset. Return the new absolute position.

`seekable()`
    Returns whether the object supports random access.

`fileno()`
    Returns the underlying file descriptor if one exists.

`close()`
    Flushes and closes the IO object.

`flush()`
    Flushes write buffers, if applicable.

`truncate(pos=None)`
    Truncates the file to size bytes. Returns the new size.

`readable()`
    Returns whether the object was opened for reading.

`writable()`
    Returns whether the object was opened for writing.

`readinto(b)`
    Reads up to len(b) bytes into b. Returns the number of bytes read.

`readline(limit=-1)`
    Reads and returns a line from the stream. If limit is specified, at most limit bytes will be read.
