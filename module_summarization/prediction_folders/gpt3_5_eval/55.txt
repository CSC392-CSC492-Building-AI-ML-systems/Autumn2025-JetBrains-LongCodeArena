Linear Model with Student-t distributed errors
===============================================

This module provides a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of a linear model with t-distributed errors. The t distribution is utilized due to its heavier tails compared to the normal distribution, making it suitable for modeling observations with outliers and heavier tails. The t-distribution offers more robust estimators for mean parameters.

The module includes a class `TLinearModel` that extends `GenericLikelihoodModel` for MLE of the linear model with t-distributed errors. The class defines methods for initializing the model, setting starting parameters, calculating the log-likelihood, and making predictions. The log-likelihood function computes the log likelihood of the model with t-distributed errors for each observation.

Additionally, the module contains a class `TArma` that inherits from `Arma` for modeling univariate ARMA processes with t-distributed errors. The log-likelihood function in this class calculates the log likelihood for each observation using the t-distribution.
