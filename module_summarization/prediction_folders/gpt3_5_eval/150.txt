## Supporting Data for Plotting Functions

The `PlotData` module provides classes and functions to enhance the flexibility of plotting functions when working with data. This allows plotting functions to seamlessly handle various types of data structures such as lists, arrays, and dataframes, along with the corresponding keys that need to be utilized.

### Overview

The `PlotData` module includes the following key components:

- **`PlotData` Class**: This class facilitates the iteration over data stored in a dictionary or dataframe. It automatically populates single defined keys to generate a list of keys for extraction. This iterative process enables the implicit definition of data for multiple plot sets without unnecessary data duplication.

### Usage Example

Here is an example demonstrating the usage of the `PlotData` class:

```python
from masci_tools.vis.data import PlotData
import numpy as np

# Define data for plotting
x = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
data = {'x': x, 'y1': np.sin(x), 'y2': np.cos(x), 'y3': x**2}

# Create a PlotData object
p = PlotData(data, x='x', y=['y1', 'y2', 'y3'])

# Iterate over the PlotData object to access the data
for entry in p:
    print(entry.x)  # Access the 'x' entry
    print(entry.y)  # Access 'y1', 'y2', and 'y3' data
```

### Features

- **Automatic Data Extraction**: The `PlotData` class automatically extracts and organizes data for plotting, allowing for efficient handling of multiple datasets.
  
- **Data Flexibility**: The module supports various data structures such as dictionaries, pandas dataframes, and Bokeh's `ColumnDataSource`, enhancing the versatility of plotting functions.

- **Data Key Management**: Users can add new data keys and initialize corresponding values, providing flexibility in data handling.

### Additional Notes

- **Bokeh Integration**: The module seamlessly integrates with Bokeh's `ColumnDataSource` for advanced plotting capabilities.

- **Data Consistency**: Users can ensure data consistency by specifying the same length for all data entries, enabling smooth data processing and visualization.
