Cross decomposition
===================

The :mod:`sklearn.cross_decomposition` module provides classes for cross decomposition techniques.

Partial Least Squares Canonical (PLSCanonical)
----------------------------------------------

:class:`sklearn.cross_decomposition.PLSCanonical` is a class that implements the Partial Least Squares Canonical (PLSCanonical) algorithm. PLSCanonical is a method for finding linear relations between two multivariate datasets X and Y by maximizing the covariance between the latent variables in X and Y.

Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSRegression)
----------------------------------------------

:class:`sklearn.cross_decomposition.PLSRegression` is a class that implements the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSRegression) algorithm. PLSRegression is a method for modeling the relationship between a set of independent variables X and a set of dependent variables Y by finding latent variables that explain the maximum covariance between X and Y.

Partial Least Squares SVD (PLSSVD)
----------------------------------

:class:`sklearn.cross_decomposition.PLSSVD` is a class that implements the Partial Least Squares SVD (PLSSVD) algorithm. PLSSVD is a method for decomposing two multivariate datasets X and Y into a set of latent variables that capture the maximum covariance between X and Y using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

These classes in the :mod:`sklearn.cross_decomposition` module provide efficient implementations of cross decomposition techniques for analyzing relationships between multiple datasets.
