# Encoding Media

The `encode_media` module provides functionality for encoding media files. It includes classes and functions for interacting with an ftrack server to manage encoding tasks.

## SessionAuthentication Class

The `SessionAuthentication` class is used to attach ftrack session authentication information to requests. It requires the API key and user information for authentication.

## Session Class

The `Session` class represents an isolated session for interaction with an ftrack server. It allows for initializing a session with various parameters such as server URL, API key, API user, cache settings, event hub connection, and plugin paths.

### Initialization Parameters

- `server_url`: The URL of the ftrack server to connect to.
- `api_key`: The API key used for authentication.
- `api_user`: The username of the user in ftrack to record operations against.
- `auto_populate`: Flag to automatically fetch entity attributes from the server.
- `plugin_paths`: List of paths to search for plugins.
- `cache`: Cache instance used for session caching.
- `cache_key_maker`: Key maker instance for generating cache keys.
- `auto_connect_event_hub`: Flag for automatically connecting to the event hub.
- `schema_cache_path`: Folder path for schema caching.
- `plugin_arguments`: Optional mapping of keyword arguments for plugin register functions.

### Methods

- `__init__()`: Initializes the session with the specified parameters.
- `__call__()`: Modifies the request to include appropriate headers for ftrack session authentication.

### Attributes

- `logger`: Logger instance for logging messages.
- `recorded_operations`: Pending operations to be recorded.
- `record_operations`: Flag to enable recording operations.

## Additional Modules

The `encode_media` module also imports various modules such as `requests`, `arrow`, `clique`, and `ftrack_api` for handling HTTP requests, date/time operations, file path manipulation, and interaction with the ftrack API.
