# Generate documentation for RequestManager and ManagerWrapper classes

The `RequestManager` class provides functionality for making synchronous and asynchronous requests using a specified provider. It allows for sending requests and receiving responses either in a blocking or non-blocking manner. The class also handles error responses and provides methods for setting the provider.

The `ManagerWrapper` class serves as a wrapper around an instance of `RequestManager`, providing access to its properties and methods. It delegates requests to the wrapped `RequestManager` instance, allowing for seamless interaction with the underlying functionality.

## RequestManager Class

### Methods

- `__init__(self, provider)`: Initializes a new `RequestManager` instance with the specified provider.
- `setProvider(self, provider)`: Sets the provider for the `RequestManager` instance.
- `request_blocking(self, method, params)`: Makes a synchronous request using the provider and returns the response.
- `request_async(self, method, params)`: Initiates an asynchronous request and returns a unique request ID.
- `receive_blocking(self, request_id, timeout=None)`: Retrieves the response for a specific request ID in a blocking manner.
- `receive_async(self, request_id, *args, **kwargs)`: Not implemented; intended for handling asynchronous responses.

## ManagerWrapper Class

### Methods

- `__init__(self, wrapped_manager)`: Initializes a new `ManagerWrapper` instance with a wrapped `RequestManager`.
- `provider`: Property that returns the provider of the wrapped `RequestManager`.
- `pending_requests`: Property that returns the pending requests of the wrapped `RequestManager`.
- `setProvider(self, provider)`: Sets the provider for the wrapped `RequestManager`.
- `request_blocking(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Delegates a synchronous request to the wrapped `RequestManager`.
- `request_async(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Delegates an asynchronous request to the wrapped `RequestManager`.
- `receive_blocking(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Delegates receiving a response in a blocking manner to the wrapped `RequestManager`.
- `receive_async(self, *args, **kwargs)`: Delegates handling asynchronous responses to the wrapped `RequestManager`.

These classes provide a structured approach to managing requests and responses within a web3 environment, offering flexibility for both synchronous and asynchronous communication with the provider.
