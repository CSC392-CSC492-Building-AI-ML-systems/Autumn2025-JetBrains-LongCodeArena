Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) are classification techniques that are implemented in scikit-learn.

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Linear Discriminant Analysis is a method used for dimensionality reduction in the context of classification. It works by finding the linear combinations of features that best separate the classes in the data. The goal of LDA is to project the data onto a lower-dimensional space while maximizing the separation between classes.

In scikit-learn, the `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis` class is available for performing LDA. It is a meta-estimator that requires a base estimator to be provided in its constructor. The `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis` extends single output estimators to multioutput estimators.

### Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

Quadratic Discriminant Analysis is another classification technique that is similar to LDA but allows for non-linear decision boundaries between classes. Unlike LDA, QDA does not assume equal covariance matrices for the classes. Instead, it estimates a separate covariance matrix for each class.

In scikit-learn, the `QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis` class is available for performing QDA. It is also a meta-estimator that requires a base estimator to be provided in its constructor. The `QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis` extends single output estimators to multioutput estimators.

Both LDA and QDA are useful techniques for classification tasks, with LDA being more suitable when the classes have similar covariance structures and QDA being more flexible in handling non-linear decision boundaries.
