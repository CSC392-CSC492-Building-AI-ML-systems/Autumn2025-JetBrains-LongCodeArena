To generate documentation for the `naive_bayes` module, you can follow these steps:

1. **Module Overview**:
The `sklearn.naive_bayes` module implements Naive Bayes algorithms for supervised learning. These algorithms are based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) feature independence assumptions.

2. **Classes**:
The module includes the following classes:
- `BernoulliNB`
- `GaussianNB`
- `MultinomialNB`
- `ComplementNB`
- `CategoricalNB`

3. **Base Class**:
The `_BaseNB` class serves as an abstract base class for naive Bayes estimators. It includes methods for computing joint log likelihood, checking input data, predicting joint log probabilities, predicting target values, and estimating probabilities.

4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**:
The `GaussianNB` class specifically implements Gaussian Naive Bayes. It supports online updates to model parameters via `partial_fit` and provides details on the algorithm used for updating feature means and variances online.

5. **Parameters**:
- `priors`: Prior probabilities of the classes.
- `var_smoothing`: Portion of the largest variance of all features added for calculation stability.

6. **Attributes**:
- `class_count_`: Number of training samples observed in each class.
- `class_prior_`: Probability of each class.
- `classes_`: Class labels known to the classifier.
- `epsilon_`: Absolute additive value to variances.
- `n_features_in_`: Number of features seen during fitting.
- `feature_names_in_`: Names of features seen during fitting (if all strings).
- `var_`: Variance of each feature per class.
- `theta_`: Mean of each feature per class.

7. **See Also**:
- `BernoulliNB`: Naive Bayes classifier for Bernoulli distributed data.

This documentation provides an overview of the `naive_bayes` module, its classes, methods, parameters, attributes, and related classes.
