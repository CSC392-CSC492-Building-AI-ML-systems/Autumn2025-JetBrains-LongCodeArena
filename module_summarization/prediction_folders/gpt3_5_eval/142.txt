dask.delayed interface
======================

The `dask.delayed` interface provides a way to delay the execution of functions and build up a task graph for parallel execution. This interface is useful for creating custom task graphs and parallelizing code that cannot be easily parallelized using other Dask collections.

Delayed Objects
---------------

The main components of the `dask.delayed` interface are the `Delayed` class and the `delayed` function. The `Delayed` class represents a delayed computation, while the `delayed` function is used to create delayed objects from functions or expressions.

Creating Delayed Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a delayed object, you can use the `delayed` function. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from dask import delayed

    @delayed
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

    result = add(1, 2)

In the example above, the `add` function is decorated with `delayed`, which creates a delayed object representing the computation of adding two numbers. The `result` variable holds the delayed object, and the actual computation is deferred until the result is needed.

Delayed Computations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Delayed objects can be combined and manipulated to build up complex task graphs. For example, you can chain multiple delayed computations together:

.. code-block:: python

    result = add(add(1, 2), add(3, 4))

In this example, the `add` function is used to chain multiple delayed computations together, creating a task graph that represents the computation of adding numbers in a specific order.

Executing Delayed Computations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To execute a delayed computation and retrieve the result, you can use the `compute` method:

.. code-block:: python

    result.compute()

The `compute` method triggers the execution of the delayed computation and returns the result. If the delayed computation depends on other delayed computations, Dask will automatically parallelize the execution based on the task graph.

Customizing Delayed Computations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize the behavior of delayed computations by providing additional arguments to the `delayed` function. For example, you can specify the scheduler to use for execution:

.. code-block:: python

    result = delayed(add)(1, 2, scheduler='threads')

In this example, the `scheduler` argument specifies that the computation should be executed using the 'threads' scheduler.
