Config Usage
============

The `ConfigParser` class provided in this module is enhanced with new features for easier configuration management. It allows for adding default configurations, validating URLs, and automatically reading from Zookeeper.

Adding Defaults
----------------

The `add_defaults` method allows you to add default configurations to the current configuration. It takes a dictionary as an argument with sections and keys to be added to the default configuration.

Traversing Includes
-------------------

The `_traverse_includes` method reads included config files, supporting nested includes. It handles both file paths and Zookeeper references for configuration inclusion.

Loading Configuration
----------------------

The `_load` method should be called only once to load the configuration. It initializes the configuration settings and can be used to specify the configuration file to be loaded.

Note: The provided code snippet is a partial representation of the complete `ConfigParser` class and its methods. For detailed usage and additional features, refer to the full implementation of the `ConfigParser` class.
