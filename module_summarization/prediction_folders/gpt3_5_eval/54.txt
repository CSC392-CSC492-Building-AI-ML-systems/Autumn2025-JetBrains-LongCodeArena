# Working with Large Data Sets

The module provides distributed estimation routines for working with large data sets. Currently, it supports several methods of distribution:

- **Sequential**: This method has no extra dependencies.
- **Parallel**:
    - **With Joblib**: A variety of backends are supported through Joblib, allowing for different types of clusters besides standard local clusters. Some examples of backends supported by Joblib are:
        - Dask.distributed
        - Yarn
        - Ipyparallel

The framework is very general and allows for a variety of estimation methods. Currently, these include:

- **Debiased Regularized Estimation**
- **Simple Coefficient Averaging (Naive)**
    - Regularized
    - Unregularized

The default method is regularized estimation with debiasing, following the methods outlined in the paper by Jason D. Lee, Qiang Liu, Yuekai Sun, and Jonathan E. Taylor titled "Communication-Efficient Sparse Regression: A One-Shot Approach" (arXiv:1503.04337, 2015).

### Variables Used in the Estimation Process

- **wexog**: A weighted design matrix used to perform the node-wise regression procedure.
- **nodewise_row**: Produced as part of the node-wise regression procedure used to produce the approximate inverse covariance matrix. One is produced for each variable using the LASSO.
- **nodewise_weight**: Produced using the gamma_hat values for each p to produce weights to reweight the gamma_hat values, which are ultimately used to form approx_inv_cov.
- **approx_inv_cov**: The estimate of the approximate inverse covariance matrix. This is used to debias the coefficient average along with the average gradient. For the OLS case, approx_inv_cov is an approximation for `n * (X^T X)^{-1}` formed by node-wise regression.

### Functions for Estimation

- **_est_regularized_naive**: Estimates the regularized fitted parameters.
- **_est_unregularized_naive**: Estimates the unregularized fitted parameters.
- **_join_naive**: Joins the results from each run of `_est_<type>_naive` and returns the mean estimate of the coefficients.
- **_calc_grad**: Calculates the log-likelihood gradient for the debiasing.
- **_calc_wdesign_mat**: Calculates the weighted design matrix necessary to generate the approximate inverse covariance matrix.
- **_est_regularized_debiased**: Estimates the regularized fitted parameters and is the default estimation method for class DistributedModel.
