Using review sessions allows users to interact with an ftrack server in an isolated environment. When initializing a session, users can specify the server URL, API key, and API user for authentication. By setting the `auto_populate` flag to True, entity attributes will be automatically fetched from the server when accessed.

Additionally, users can provide plugin paths for searching, a cache for session data storage, and a key maker for generating keys for cached objects. The session also supports schema caching and event hub connection for publishing and subscribing to events.

To create a review session, ensure the required server URL, API key, and API user are provided. The session will manage pending operations and cache key generation, offering a seamless interaction experience with the ftrack server.
