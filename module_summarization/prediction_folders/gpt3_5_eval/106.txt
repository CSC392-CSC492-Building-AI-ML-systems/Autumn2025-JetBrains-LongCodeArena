====================================

This module serves the purpose of expanding Hypergeometric (and Meijer G) functions into named special functions. The algorithm implemented in this module utilizes a collection of lookup tables of hypergeometric functions and their properties to efficiently expand many hypergeometric functions in terms of special functions.

The core functionality of this module is based on the paper by Kelly B. Roach titled "Meijer G Function Representations," which was presented at the 1997 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation.

Summary of Extensions for Meijer G Functions
--------------------------------------------

- The module provides extensions for Meijer G functions, including operations such as z**rho G(ap, bq; z) = G(ap + rho, bq + rho; z).
- It introduces shift operators A_J, B_J, C_J, and D_J, along with their corresponding inverse-shift operators, to manipulate the parameters of the special functions.
- Order reduction techniques are employed to simplify the expressions involving gamma functions and G functions of lower order.
- The module discusses paired index theorems for reducing the order of special functions based on specific parameter conditions.
- It defines suitable index quadruples and explores the concept of reachability between different index quadruples using hand-built routines.

Functionality and Implementation Details
----------------------------------------

The module includes a collection of formulas and knowledge base entries for various hypergeometric functions. These entries are added using the `add_formulae` function, which populates the knowledge base with specific formulas and their corresponding parameters.

The implementation leverages functionalities from the SymPy library, including mathematical functions like Chi, Ci, Ei, Piecewise, besseli, besselj, erf, exp, gamma, log, sin, cos, sinh, cosh, and more. It also utilizes classes and methods from the SymPy core, functions, and printing modules to handle expressions and output formatting.

Additionally, the module defines a function `_mod1` to categorize expressions into "buckets" based on their modulo 1 values, facilitating sorting and organization of mathematical entities.

Overall, this module provides a comprehensive framework for expanding hypergeometric functions into special functions, offering a rich set of tools and techniques for efficient mathematical transformations.
