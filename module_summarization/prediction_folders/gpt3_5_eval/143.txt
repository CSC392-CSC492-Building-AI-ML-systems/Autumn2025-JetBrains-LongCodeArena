# Managing Memory

The `dask` library provides various utilities for managing memory efficiently in distributed computing environments. This documentation outlines key concepts and classes related to memory management in `dask`.

## Global Clients

- `_global_clients`: A `WeakValueDictionary` that stores references to global `Client` instances.
- `_global_client_index`: A list used to keep track of global client indices.

### Functions

- `_get_global_client()`: Returns the global `Client` instance.
- `_set_global_client(c: Client | None)`: Sets the global `Client` instance.
- `_del_global_client(c: Client)`: Deletes the global `Client` instance.

## Future Class

The `Future` class represents a remotely running computation in `dask`.

### Parameters

- `key`: Key of the remote data to which the future refers.
- `client`: The `Client` that owns this future.
- `inform`: Boolean indicating whether to inform the scheduler about the future.
- `state`: The state of the future.

### Methods

- `result()`: Retrieves the result of the future.
- `exception()`: Retrieves the exception and traceback of the future.

### Examples

```python
my_future = client.submit(add, 1, 2)
print(my_future)
# Output: <Future: status: finished, key: add-8f6e709446674bad78ea8aeecfee188e>

result = my_future.result()
```

The `Future` class allows users to track the progress and results of computations running on remote workers.
