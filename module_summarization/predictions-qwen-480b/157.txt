Introduction to Nextcord
========================

Nextcord is a powerful Python library designed for interacting with the Discord API. It provides an object-oriented approach to working with Discord's features, making it easier for developers to create bots and applications that integrate seamlessly with the platform.

Key Features
------------

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Nextcord models Discord objects such as users, channels, and guilds as Python classes, allowing for intuitive interaction with the API.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Built on top of asyncio, Nextcord supports asynchronous operations, enabling efficient handling of events and API calls.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and examples help developers get started quickly and make the most of the library.
- **Active Community**: Nextcord benefits from an active community of developers who contribute to its growth and provide support through various channels.

Getting Started
---------------

To begin using Nextcord, install it via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install nextcord

Once installed, you can start building your bot by importing the library and creating a client instance:

.. code-block:: python

    import nextcord
    from nextcord.ext import commands

    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

    @bot.event
    async def on_ready():
        print(f'Logged in as {bot.user}')

    bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')

Widgets in Nextcord
-------------------

Nextcord also provides support for Discord's widget feature, which allows you to display real-time information about your server. The library includes classes such as `Widget`, `WidgetMember`, and `WidgetChannel` to represent and interact with widget data.

For example, you can retrieve and display information about online members and accessible channels within a guild's widget.
