Random Projection

Random Projection is a simple and computationally efficient dimensionality reduction technique that trades a controlled amount of accuracy (as additional variance) for faster processing times and smaller model sizes. It works by projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space using a random matrix.

Theoretical Background
----------------------

The main theoretical result behind the efficiency of random projection is the `Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma>`_:

    In mathematics, the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is a result concerning low-distortion embeddings of points from high-dimensional into low-dimensional Euclidean space. The lemma states that a small set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are nearly preserved. The map used for the embedding is at least Lipschitz, and can even be taken to be an orthogonal projection.

This means that the pairwise distances between any two samples in the dataset are approximately preserved after the random projection.
