w_trace
=======

The ``w_trace`` command is used to trace the history of a trajectory segment back to its initial state in a WESTPA simulation. This tool provides detailed information about the path a trajectory took through the progress coordinate space, including weights, timing information, and other metadata for each segment in the trace.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    w_trace [options] <iteration> <segment_id>

Arguments
---------

- ``iteration``: The iteration number of the final segment in the trace.
- ``segment_id``: The segment ID of the final segment in the trace.

Options
-------

- ``-h, --help``: Show help message and exit.
- ``--rcfile=RCFILE``: Use the specified RCFILE instead of the default west.cfg.
- ``--data-file=DATA_FILE``: Use the specified data file instead of the default west.h5.

Description
-----------

The ``w_trace`` command constructs a trace of a trajectory by following the parent-child relationships between segments across iterations. Starting from a specified segment in a given iteration, it recursively traces back through the simulation history to the initial state.

Each segment in the trace includes the following information:

- ``n_iter``: The iteration number of the segment.
- ``seg_id``: The segment ID within that iteration.
- ``weight``: The statistical weight of the segment.
- ``walltime``: The wall-clock time taken to propagate the segment.
- ``cputime``: The CPU time taken to propagate the segment.
- ``final_pcoord``: The final progress coordinate value of the segment.

The trace also identifies the initial state and basis state from which the trajectory originated. This information is useful for understanding the pathway a particular trajectory took, analyzing convergence, and identifying important pathways in the simulation.

Examples
--------

To trace a trajectory ending in segment 5 of iteration 100:

.. code-block:: bash

    w_trace 100 5

This will output a detailed trace showing all segments from the initial state to the specified segment, including weights and timing information for each step in the trajectory.
