Table Data
==========

The provided code includes utilities for handling verification and error reporting in table data structures. These utilities are designed to ensure data integrity and provide mechanisms for correcting or reporting issues within table data.

Verification Framework
----------------------

The verification framework consists of several components that work together to validate and correct data:

- ``_Verify``: A base class that provides shared methods for verification processes. It supports multiple verification options such as fixing errors, issuing warnings, or raising exceptions.
- ``VerifyError``: An exception class used to signal verification errors that cannot be automatically corrected.
- ``VerifyWarning``: A warning class used to report issues that do not halt execution but may require attention.
- ``VERIFY_OPTIONS``: A list of supported verification options that control how errors are handled during verification.

Error Handling and Reporting
----------------------------

The ``_ErrList`` class is used to manage lists of verification errors. It supports a nested structure to represent errors at different levels of a data hierarchy. The class provides methods for iterating over errors with appropriate indentation to reflect their structural position.

Notifier Mixin
--------------

The ``NotifierMixin`` class provides a mechanism for implementing the observer pattern. It allows objects to register listeners that are notified of changes. This can be useful for implementing reactive systems where components need to respond to changes in table data.

Supported Data Types
--------------------

The code defines a tuple ``all_integer_types`` that includes both Python's built-in ``int`` type and NumPy's integer types. This ensures that integer data in tables is handled consistently across different numerical libraries.

Path-like Objects
-----------------

The ``path_like`` tuple defines types that are considered path-like, including ``str``, ``bytes``, and ``os.PathLike``. This is used to ensure that file paths are handled correctly across different operating systems and Python versions.

Helper Functions
----------------

- ``cmp``: A comparison function that returns -1, 0, or 1 based on the comparison of two values. This is used for sorting or comparing data elements.
- ``indent``: A utility function from ``astropy.utils`` that is used to format text output with proper indentation.
- ``warnings.warn``: Used to issue warnings to the user, which can be configured to be silent, printed, or raised as exceptions.

These components work together to provide a robust framework for managing table data, ensuring that data integrity is maintained and that users are informed of any issues that arise during data processing.
