Quick Start
===========

This guide will help you get started quickly with using the `toppra` library for time-optimal path parameterization.

Overview
--------

The `toppra` library requires geometric paths that implement the :class:`AbstractGeometricPath` interface. These paths are used as input to the time-parameterization algorithms.

Creating a Geometric Path
-------------------------

To use `toppra`, you first need to define a geometric path. This can be done by implementing the :class:`AbstractGeometricPath` class or using one of the provided wrappers, such as :class:`RaveTrajectoryWrapper` for OpenRAVE trajectories.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from toppra import AbstractGeometricPath
    import numpy as np

    class MyPath(AbstractGeometricPath):
        def __call__(self, path_positions, order=0):
            # Implement path evaluation logic here
            pass

        @property
        def dof(self):
            return 1  # Degrees of freedom

        @property
        def path_interval(self):
            return np.array([0, 1])  # Path interval

Gridpoint Generation
--------------------

To ensure accurate parameterization, you may need to generate gridpoints along your path. The function :func:`propose_gridpoints` helps generate these points based on the curvature of the path.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from toppra import propose_gridpoints

    gridpoints = propose_gridpoints(my_path, max_err_threshold=1e-4)

This function ensures that the gridpoints are sufficiently dense in areas of high curvature, improving the accuracy of the time-parameterization algorithm.

Using OpenRAVE Trajectories
---------------------------

If you are working with OpenRAVE trajectories, you can wrap them using :class:`RaveTrajectoryWrapper`. This class supports quadratic and cubic interpolation methods.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from toppra import RaveTrajectoryWrapper

    wrapped_path = RaveTrajectoryWrapper(traj, robot)

Ensure that your OpenRAVE trajectory uses either quadratic or cubic interpolation for compatibility.

Next Steps
----------

Once you have defined your geometric path and generated appropriate gridpoints, you can proceed to use the main `toppra` algorithms for time-optimal path parameterization. Refer to the full documentation for more details on setting up constraints and running the solver.
