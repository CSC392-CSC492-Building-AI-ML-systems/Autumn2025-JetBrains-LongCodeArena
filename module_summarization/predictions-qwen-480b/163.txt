Tensor Attributes
=================

In the OneFlow MLIR dialect, tensors are fundamental data structures that carry both data and metadata. Tensor attributes provide a way to describe and manipulate the properties of tensors at the IR level. These attributes are used to specify tensor characteristics such as shape, data type, and layout, which are essential for optimization and code generation.

Shape Attribute
---------------

The shape attribute describes the dimensions of a tensor. It is represented as an array of integers where each integer corresponds to the size of a dimension. For example, a 2D tensor with 3 rows and 4 columns would have a shape attribute of [3, 4].

Data Type Attribute
-------------------

The data type attribute specifies the type of data stored in the tensor. Common data types include integers (i32, i64), floating-point numbers (f32, f64), and booleans (i1). This attribute is crucial for determining the size and interpretation of the tensor's data.

Layout Attribute
----------------

The layout attribute defines how the tensor's data is organized in memory. Different layouts can impact performance, especially in operations that access tensor elements in specific patterns. Common layouts include row-major and column-major.

Device Attribute
----------------

The device attribute indicates the hardware device on which the tensor resides. This can include CPU, GPU, or other specialized accelerators. The device attribute is important for generating device-specific code and managing memory allocation.

Memory Attribute
----------------

The memory attribute describes the memory space in which the tensor's data is stored. This includes attributes such as whether the data is in global memory, shared memory, or constant memory. Memory attributes help optimize memory access patterns and data movement.

Stride Attribute
----------------

The stride attribute specifies the number of elements to skip in memory to move from one element to the next along each dimension. Strides are particularly useful for describing non-contiguous tensor views and optimizing memory access.

These tensor attributes work together to provide a comprehensive description of tensor properties, enabling the OneFlow compiler to perform sophisticated optimizations and generate efficient code for various hardware targets.
