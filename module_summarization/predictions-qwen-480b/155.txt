Getting Started
===============

Welcome to Mitogen! This guide will help you get started with using Mitogen
for distributed computing and remote execution.

Overview
--------

Mitogen is a Python library that enables efficient communication and code
execution across multiple processes and machines. It is designed to minimize
startup latency and overhead, making it ideal for scenarios where you need to
execute code remotely or in parallel.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 2.4 or higher (Python 3.x is also supported)
- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)

Installation
------------

To install Mitogen, you can use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install mitogen

Alternatively, you can download the source code and install it manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/dw/mitogen.git
    $ cd mitogen
    $ python setup.py install

Basic Usage
-----------

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to use Mitogen for remote execution:

1. Create a script named ``master.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    import mitogen.master

    def main():
        broker = mitogen.master.Broker()
        try:
            # Connect to a remote host via SSH
            remote = broker.connect_ssh(hostname='example.com', username='user')
            # Execute a command on the remote host
            result = remote.call(sys.executable, '-c', 'print("Hello from remote!")')
            print(result.stdout)
        finally:
            broker.shutdown()
            broker.join()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

2. Run the script:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python master.py

This will connect to the specified remote host and execute a simple command,
printing the output locally.

Key Concepts
------------

- **Broker**: Manages connections and communication between processes.
- **Context**: Represents a connection to a remote process or machine.
- **Call**: Executes a function or command in a remote context.

provided with the Mitogen source code.
