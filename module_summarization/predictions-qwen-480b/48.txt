Zero-Inflated Models
====================

The ``discretemod`` module provides implementations of zero-inflated models for count data. These models are used when the data exhibits an excess of zero counts that cannot be adequately explained by standard count models like Poisson or Negative Binomial.

Generic Zero-Inflated Model
---------------------------

.. autoclass:: statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model.GenericZeroInflated
   :members:

The generic zero-inflated model serves as the base class for implementing specific zero-inflated models. It combines a binary model (typically Logit or Probit) for predicting whether an observation is zero or not, with a count model for the non-zero observations.

Parameters
----------

The zero-inflated models accept the following parameters:

exog_infl : array_like or None
    Explanatory variables for the binary inflation model, i.e. for
    mixing probability model. If None, then a constant is used.
offset : array_like
    Offset is added to the linear prediction with coefficient equal to 1.
exposure : array_like
    Log(exposure) is added to the linear prediction with coefficient
    equal to 1.
inflation : string, 'logit' or 'probit'
    The model for the zero inflation, either Logit (default) or Probit

Attributes
----------

endog : array
    A reference to the endogenous response variable
exog : array
    A reference to the exogenous design.
exog_infl: array
    A reference to the zero-inflated exogenous design.

Log-Likelihood Functions
------------------------

The log-likelihood functions for the zero-inflated models are defined as:

For the overall log-likelihood:
.. math:: \ln L=\sum_{y_{i}=0}\ln(w_{i}+(1-w_{i})*P_{main\_model})+
         \sum_{y_{i}>0}(\ln(1-w_{i})+L_{main\_model})

For individual observations:
.. math:: \ln L=\ln(w_{i}+(1-w_{i})*P_{main\_model})+
         \ln(1-w_{i})+L_{main\_model}

where P is the probability density function of the main model and L is the log-likelihood function of the main model for observations :math:`i=1,...,n`.
