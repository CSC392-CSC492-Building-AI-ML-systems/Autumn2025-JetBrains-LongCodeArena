Compatibility Policy
====================

The ``numpy.random`` module follows the standard NumPy compatibility policy,
which adheres to Semantic Versioning (SemVer). This document outlines the
compatibility guarantees and policies specific to the ``numpy.random`` module.

Versioning
----------

NumPy uses a versioning scheme of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. Compatibility
guarantees are as follows:

- **MAJOR** version changes may introduce breaking changes.
- **MINOR** version changes may introduce new features but will maintain
  backward compatibility.
- **PATCH** versions will maintain both backward and forward compatibility,
  only including bug fixes.

Deprecation Policy
------------------

When a feature or API in ``numpy.random`` is deprecated:

1. A deprecation warning will be issued when the deprecated feature is used.
2. The deprecated feature will remain functional for at least two minor
   releases.
3. After the deprecation period, the feature may be removed in a future
   release.

Users are encouraged to update their code to use the new APIs when available
to ensure continued compatibility.

API Stability
-------------

The following APIs in ``numpy.random`` are considered stable and are
guaranteed to be backward compatible within the same major version:

- All public functions and classes in the main ``numpy.random`` namespace.
- The ``numpy.random.Generator`` and ``numpy.random.RandomState`` classes.
- All bit generator classes (e.g., ``MT19937``, ``PCG64``, ``Philox``, etc.).
- The ``numpy.random.seed``, ``numpy.random.rand``, ``numpy.random.randn``,
  and other legacy functions (though their use is discouraged in favor of
  ``Generator``).

C Extension Compatibility
-------------------------

The C extensions and libraries built for ``numpy.random``, including
``npyrandom`` and the Cython extensions, are considered internal
implementation details. While they are installed and available for use,
their APIs are not guaranteed to be stable across versions.

Users who depend on these internal components do so at their own risk and
should expect potential breaking changes even in minor releases.

Examples and Test Compatibility
-------------------------------

The examples and tests provided in the ``numpy.random`` module are intended
for educational and testing purposes. While efforts are made to keep them
up-to-date and functional, they are not covered by the same compatibility
guarantees as the main API.

License Compatibility
---------------------

The ``numpy.random`` module is dual-licensed under the same licenses as
NumPy itself: the BSD 3-Clause License and the University of Illinois/NCSA
Open Source License. These licenses are compatible with a wide range of
open-source and proprietary software.
