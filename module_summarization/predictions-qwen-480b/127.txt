Built-In Kernels
================

The convolution module provides a set of built-in kernel models that can be used for convolution operations. These kernels are implemented as subclasses of the :class:`~astropy.convolution.Kernel1D` and :class:`~astropy.convolution.Kernel2D` classes.

1D Kernels
----------

BoxKernel1D
^^^^^^^^^^^
A 1D box kernel, which is a uniform kernel with constant value across its width.

GaussianKernel1D
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A 1D Gaussian kernel, defined by its standard deviation (sigma). This kernel is useful for smoothing data.

2D Kernels
----------

BoxKernel2D
^^^^^^^^^^^
A 2D box kernel, which is a uniform kernel with constant value across its area.

GaussianKernel2D
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A 2D Gaussian kernel, defined by its standard deviation (sigma). This kernel is useful for smoothing 2D data.

TophatKernel2D
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A 2D tophat kernel, which is a circular kernel with constant value within a given radius and zero outside.

Custom Kernel Creation
----------------------

In addition to the built-in kernels, users can create custom kernels by subclassing the :class:`~astropy.convolution.Kernel1D` or :class:`~astropy.convolution.Kernel2D` classes and implementing the necessary methods.

Kernel Properties
-----------------

All kernel objects have the following properties:

- ``array``: The kernel array
- ``shape``: The shape of the kernel
- ``center``: The center of the kernel
- `` normalization ``: The normalization of the kernel

Kernel Operations
-----------------

Kernels can be combined using arithmetic operations:

- Addition: ``kernel1 + kernel2``
- Subtraction: ``kernel1 - kernel2``
- Multiplication: ``kernel1 * kernel2``
- Division: ``kernel1 / kernel2``

These operations return new kernel objects that represent the combined kernels.
