Pairwise Metrics, Affinities and Kernels
========================================

Introduction
------------

The :mod:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise` module implements utilities to evaluate pairwise distances, affinities, and kernels between samples. These functions are used in various algorithms such as clustering, classification, and manifold learning.

Pairwise Metrics
----------------

Pairwise metrics compute the distance or similarity between pairs of samples. The most common use case is to compute the distance matrix between all pairs of samples in a dataset.

Distance Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following distance metrics are available:

- **Euclidean Distance**: The straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
- **Manhattan Distance**: The sum of absolute differences between coordinates.
- **Cosine Distance**: One minus the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
- **Chebyshev Distance**: The maximum absolute difference between coordinates.
- **Minkowski Distance**: A generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distances.
- **Hamming Distance**: The proportion of differing elements in binary vectors.
- **Jaccard Distance**: The complement of the Jaccard similarity coefficient.
- **Mahalanobis Distance**: The distance between a point and a distribution.

Affinities
----------

Affinity measures quantify the similarity between samples. High affinity indicates high similarity.

Common affinity measures include:

- **Cosine Similarity**: The cosine of the angle between two vectors.
- **RBF (Radial Basis Function)**: Also known as Gaussian kernel, measures similarity based on Euclidean distance.
- **Polynomial Kernel**: Computes similarity using polynomial functions.
- **Sigmoid Kernel**: Similar to the sigmoid function used in neural networks.

Kernels
-------

Kernels are functions that compute the inner product between two vectors in a high-dimensional space without explicitly mapping the vectors to that space. They are widely used in kernel methods such as Support Vector Machines.

Available kernels include:

- **Linear Kernel**: The standard inner product between two vectors.
- **Polynomial Kernel**: Defined as :math:`(gamma \langle x, y \rangle + coef0)^degree`.
- **RBF Kernel**: Defined as :math:`\exp(-gamma \|x-y\|^2)`.
- **Sigmoid Kernel**: Defined as :math:`\tanh(gamma \langle x, y \rangle + coef0)`.
- **Chi-Squared Kernel**: Suitable for comparing histograms.

Utility Functions
-----------------

The module also provides utility functions for handling arrays and validating inputs:

- **check_pairwise_arrays**: Ensures input arrays are valid for pairwise computations.
- **check_paired_arrays**: Validates inputs for paired distance computations.
- **pairwise_distances**: Computes the distance matrix between all pairs of samples.
- **pairwise_kernels**: Computes the kernel matrix between all pairs of samples.

These utilities ensure that inputs are properly formatted and validated before computing pairwise metrics, affinities, or kernels.
