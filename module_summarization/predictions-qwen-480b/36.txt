.. _w_succ:

``w_succ``: List Successful Trajectories
========================================

The ``w_succ`` command lists all trajectory segments that have successfully reached a target state (i.e., have been recycled). This is useful for analyzing which trajectories contributed to recycling events during a WESTPA simulation.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    w_succ [-h] [-o OUTPUT_FILE]

Description
-----------

``w_succ`` scans through the WESTPA simulation data and identifies segments whose endpoints indicate they have been recycled. For each such segment, the command outputs the iteration number, segment ID, weight, and final progress coordinate values.

Output Format
-------------

The output is written in a tabular format with the following columns:

- **Iteration**: The WESTPA iteration in which the segment was run.
- **Segment ID**: The ID of the segment within that iteration.
- **Weight**: The statistical weight of the segment.
- **Final Progress Coordinate Values**: The final values of the progress coordinate(s) for the segment.

Example Output
--------------

.. code-block:: text

    # successful (recycled) segments
    # column 0:    iteration
    # column 1:    seg_id
    # column 2:    weight
    # column>2:    final progress coordinate value
         100         5    1.23456789012345e-05       0.998765432109876
         101        12    9.87654321098765e-06       0.999123456789012

Options
-------

.. option:: -o, --output OUTPUT_FILE

    Store output in ``OUTPUT_FILE``. By default, output is written to standard output.

.. option:: -h, --help

    Show help message and exit.

Dependencies
------------

- WESTPA simulation data (HDF5 files)
- Properly configured WESTPA environment
