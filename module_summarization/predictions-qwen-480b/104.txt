Diophantine
===========

.. module:: diofant.solvers.diophantine

The Diophantine module in Diofant is designed to solve Diophantine equations, which are polynomial equations where only integer solutions are sought. This module provides tools to classify and solve various types of Diophantine equations.

Functions
---------

diophantine
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: diophantine(eq, param=symbols('t', integer=True), syms=None)

   Simplify the solution procedure of diophantine equation ``eq`` by converting it into a product of terms which should equal zero.

   For example, `(x + y)(x - y) = 0` is solved by independently solving `x + y = 0` and `x - y = 0` and combining the results. Each term is solved by calling ``diop_solve()``.

   The output of ``diophantine()`` is a set of tuples. The elements of the tuple are the solutions for each variable in the equation and are arranged according to the alphabetic ordering of the variables. For an equation with two variables, `a` and `b`, the first element of the tuple is the solution for `a` and the second for `b`.

   :param eq: An equation (to be solved), either as a Relational or an Expr.
   :param param: The parameter to be used in the solution (default is a symbol `t` with integer=True).
   :param syms: A list of symbols which determines the order of the elements in the returned tuple (optional).

   :returns: A set of tuples representing the solutions to the equation.

   Examples
   --------

   >>> diophantine(x**2 - y**2)
   {(t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0)}

   >>> diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))
   {(0, n1, n2), (t_0, t_1, 2*t_0 + 3*t_1)}
   
   >>> diophantine(x**2 + 3*x*y + 4*x)
   {(0, n1), (3*t_0 - 4, -t_0)}

classify_diop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. function:: classify_diop(eq, _dict=True)

   Helper routine used in the diophantine module to determine the type of the given equation. It analyzes the equation and returns information about its structure, which is used to select the appropriate solving method.

   :param eq: The equation to classify.
   :param _dict: If True, returns a dictionary with classification details; otherwise, returns a tuple.

   :returns: Classification information about the equation.

Supported Equation Types
------------------------

The Diophantine module supports solving several types of equations, including:

- Linear Diophantine equations
- Binary quadratic equations
- Homogeneous ternary quadratic equations
- General Pythagorean equations
- General sum of squares
- General sum of even powers
- Univariate equations
- Cubic Thue equations
- Inhomogeneous general quadratic equations
- Inhomogeneous ternary quadratic equations

Each equation type is handled by a specific solving routine tailored to its mathematical properties.

Internal Functions
------------------

The module also includes several internal helper functions that support the main solving routines:

- `_is_int`: Checks if a value is an integer.
- `_sorted_tuple`: Returns a sorted tuple of input values.
- `_remove_gcd`: Removes the greatest common divisor from a sequence of integers.
- `_rational_pq`: Returns the numerator and denominator of a rational number in reduced form.
- `_nint_or_floor`: Returns the nearest integer to a rational number, with ties broken by flooring.
- `_odd` and `_even`: Check if an integer is odd or even, respectively.

These functions are used internally to support the equation solving and classification processes.
