Linear Mixed Effects Models
===========================

Linear mixed effects models are regression models for dependent data.
They can be used to estimate regression relationships involving both
means and variances.

These models are also known as multilevel linear models, and
hierarchical linear models.

The ``MixedLM`` class fits linear mixed effects models to data, and
provides support for some common post-estimation tasks. This is a
group-based implementation that is most efficient for models in which
the data can be partitioned into independent groups. Some models with
crossed effects can be handled by specifying a model with a single
group.

The data are partitioned into disjoint groups. The probability model
for group ``i`` is:

.. math::

   Y = X \beta + Z \gamma + \epsilon

where

* :math:`n_i` is the number of observations in group :math:`i`

* :math:`Y` is a :math:`n_i` dimensional response vector (called ``endog`` in ``MixedLM``)

* :math:`X` is a :math:`n_i \times k_{fe}` dimensional design matrix for the fixed effects
  (called ``exog`` in ``MixedLM``)

* :math:`\beta` is a :math:`k_{fe}`-dimensional vector of fixed effects parameters
  (called ``fe_params`` in ``MixedLM``)

* :math:`Z` is a design matrix for the random effects with :math:`n_i` rows (called
  ``exog_re`` in ``MixedLM``). The number of columns in :math:`Z` can vary by group
  as discussed below.

* :math:`\gamma` is a random vector with mean 0. The covariance matrix for the
  first :math:`k_{re}` elements of :math:`\gamma` (called ``cov_re`` in ``MixedLM``) is
  common to all groups. The remaining elements of :math:`\gamma` are
  variance components as discussed in more detail below. Each group
  receives its own independent realization of :math:`\gamma`.

* :math:`\epsilon` is a :math:`n_i` dimensional vector of iid normal
  errors with mean 0 and variance :math:`\sigma^2`; the :math:`\epsilon`
  values are independent both within and between groups.

:math:`Y`, :math:`X` and :math:`Z` must be entirely observed. :math:`\beta`, :math:`\Psi`, and :math:`\sigma^2` are
estimated using ML or REML estimation, and :math:`\gamma` and :math:`\epsilon` are
random so define the probability model.

The marginal mean structure is :math:`E[Y | X, Z] = X \beta`. If only the mean
structure is of interest, GEE is an alternative to using linear mixed
models.

Two types of random effects are supported. Standard random effects
are correlated with each other in arbitrary ways. Every group has the
same number (:math:`k_{re}`) of standard random effects, with the same joint
distribution (but with independent realizations across the groups).

Variance components are uncorrelated with each other, and with the
standard random effects. Each variance component has mean zero, and
all realizations of a given variance component have the same variance
parameter. The number of realized variance components per variance
parameter can differ across the groups.

The primary reference for the implementation details is:

linear mixed effects models for repeated measures data". Journal of

All the likelihood, gradient, and Hessian calculations closely follow
Lindstrom and Bates 1988, adapted to support variance components.

The following two documents are written more from the perspective of

Notation:

* ``cov_re`` is the random effects covariance matrix (referred to above
  as :math:`\Psi`) and ``scale`` is the (scalar) error variance. For a single
  group, the marginal covariance matrix of endog given exog is ``scale*I``
  + ``Z * cov_re * Z'``, where ``Z`` is the design matrix for the random
  effects in one group.

* ``vcomp`` is a vector of variance parameters. The length of ``vcomp``
  is determined by the number of keys in either the ``exog_vc`` argument
  to ``MixedLM``, or the ``vc_formula`` argument when using formulas to
  fit a model.

Notes:

1. Three different parameterizations are used in different places.
The regression slopes (usually called ``fe_params``) are identical in
all three parameterizations, but the variance parameters differ. The
parameterizations are:

* The "user parameterization" in which :math:`cov(endog) = scale*I + Z *
  cov_re * Z'`, as described above. This is the main parameterization
  visible to the user.

* The "profile parameterization" in which :math:`cov(endog) = I +
  Z * cov_re1 * Z'`. This is the parameterization of the profile
  likelihood that is maximized to produce parameter estimates.
  (see Lindstrom and Bates for details). The "user" ``cov_re`` is
  equal to the "profile" ``cov_re1`` times the scale.

* The "square root parameterization" in which we work with the Cholesky
  factor of ``cov_re1`` instead of ``cov_re`` directly. This is hidden from the
  user.

All three parameterizations can be packed into a vector by
(optionally) concatenating ``fe_params`` together with the lower
triangle or Cholesky square root of the dependence structure, followed
by the variance parameters for the variance components. The are
stored as square roots if (and only if) the random effects covariance
matrix is stored as its Choleky factor. Note that when unpacking, it
is important to either square or reflect the dependence structure
depending on which parameterization is being used.

Two score methods are implemented. One takes the score with respect
to the elements of the random effects covariance matrix (used for
inference once the MLE is reached), and the other takes the score with
respect to the parameters of the Choleky square root of the random
effects covariance matrix (used for optimization).

The numerical optimization uses GLS to avoid explicitly optimizing
over the fixed effects parameters. The likelihood that is optimized
is profiled over both the scale parameter (a scalar) and the fixed
effects parameters (if any). As a result of this profiling, it is
difficult and unnecessary to calculate the Hessian of the profiled log
likelihood function, so that calculation is not implemented here.
Therefore, optimization methods requiring the Hessian matrix such as
the Newton-Raphson algorithm cannot be used for model fitting.
