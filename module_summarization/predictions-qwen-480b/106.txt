Hypergeometric Function Expansion
=================================

This module is responsible for expanding hypergeometric and Meijer G functions into named special functions. It uses a collection of lookup tables and various properties of hypergeometric functions to achieve this.

The expansion algorithm is based on the following paper:

    Kelly B. Roach. *Meijer G Function Representations*. In: Proceedings of the 1997 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, pages 205-211, New York, 1997. ACM.

The implementation is described in greater detail in the Sphinx documentation.

Key Features
------------

- Expands hypergeometric functions using a database of known identities.
- Handles Meijer G functions through various transformations and reduction techniques.
- Implements shift operators for manipulating the parameters of Meijer G functions.
- Reduces the order of functions when certain conditions are met, simplifying expressions.

Algorithm Overview
------------------

The core idea is to match a given hypergeometric or Meijer G function against a set of known identities stored in a lookup table. When a match is found, the function is rewritten in terms of simpler, named special functions.

For Meijer G functions, the following transformations are used:

1. **Scaling Property**: :math:`z^\rho G^{m,n}_{p,q}\left( z \middle| \begin{matrix} a_1, \ldots, a_p \\ b_1, \ldots, b_q \end{matrix} \right) = G^{m,n}_{p,q}\left( z \middle| \begin{matrix} a_1 + \rho, \ldots, a_p + \rho \\ b_1 + \rho, \ldots, b_q + \rho \end{matrix} \right)`

2. **Shift Operators**: These operators increment or decrement the parameters of the Meijer G function:
   - :math:`A_J = b_J - D`, where :math:`D = z \frac{d}{dz}`
   - :math:`B_J = 1 - a_j + D`
   - :math:`C_J = -b_J + D`
   - :math:`D_J = a_J - 1 - D`

3. **Order Reduction**: If :math:`b_j - a_i` is a non-negative integer (with certain constraints), the function can be reduced to a lower-order form.

4. **Paired Index Theorems**: Under specific conditions involving integer differences between parameters, the order of the function can be reduced further.

Implementation Details
----------------------

The module uses a combination of symbolic manipulation and pattern matching to identify and apply transformations. It leverages SymPy's expression handling capabilities to work with symbolic parameters and simplify expressions.

Known Formulae
--------------

The module includes implementations for various standard hypergeometric identities, including:

- :math:`{}_0F_0` functions, which reduce to the exponential function.
- :math:`{}_1F_0` functions, related to power functions.
- :math:`{}_2F_1` functions, which cover a wide range of special functions including elliptic integrals, trigonometric functions, and logarithms.

These are implemented using symbolic matrices and recursive relationships to allow for efficient computation and transformation.
