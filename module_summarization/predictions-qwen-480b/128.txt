Miscellaneous Features
======================

This section covers various miscellaneous features and utilities provided by
the ``astropy.io.fits`` module that do not fall under the main categories of
reading, writing, or manipulating FITS files. These include verification
options, error handling, and internal utilities that support the overall
functionality of the module.

Verification Options
--------------------

The ``astropy.io.fits`` module provides a flexible verification system that
allows users to control how potential issues in FITS files are handled. This
is particularly useful when dealing with files that may not fully conform to
the FITS standard but can still be processed with appropriate warnings or
corrections.

The verification options can be set when opening or manipulating FITS files,
and they control both the reporting and automatic fixing of issues. The
available options are:

- ``ignore``: Ignore all verification issues.
- ``warn``: Issue warnings for verification issues but continue processing.
- ``exception``: Raise exceptions for verification issues, halting processing.
- ``fix``: Attempt to fix issues and report any unfixable errors.
- ``silentfix``: Attempt to fix issues silently without reporting.
- ``fix+ignore``: Fix issues but ignore any unfixable errors.
- ``fix+warn``: Fix issues and warn about any unfixable errors.
- ``fix+exception``: Fix issues but raise an exception for unfixable errors.
- ``silentfix+ignore``: Silently fix issues and ignore any unfixable errors.
- ``silentfix+warn``: Silently fix issues and warn about any unfixable errors.
- ``silentfix+exception``: Silently fix issues but raise an exception for unfixable errors.

These options can be passed to various methods in the ``astropy.io.fits`` API
that perform verification, such as when opening a file or accessing header
information.

Error Handling
--------------

The module defines custom exception and warning classes to handle FITS-specific
errors and warnings:

- ``VerifyError``: Raised when verification issues are encountered and the
  ``exception`` option is used.
- ``VerifyWarning``: Issued when verification issues are encountered and the
  ``warn`` option is used.

These classes allow users to catch and handle FITS-related issues separately
from other Python exceptions and warnings.

Internal Utilities
------------------

The ``astropy.io.fits`` module includes several internal utilities that support
its functionality:

Notifier Mixin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``NotifierMixin`` class provides a mechanism for internal communication
between objects. It allows objects to register listeners that are notified of
changes. This is used internally to keep different parts of a FITS file object
in sync when modifications are made.

This mixin is not intended for direct use by end-users but is a key part of
the internal architecture of the module.

Helper Functions and Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Various helper functions and classes are used internally to support operations
such as:

- Path handling and file I/O operations.
- Data type comparisons and conversions.
- Memory mapping and temporary file management.
- Context management for safe file operations.

These utilities ensure that the module operates efficiently and safely across
different platforms and environments.
