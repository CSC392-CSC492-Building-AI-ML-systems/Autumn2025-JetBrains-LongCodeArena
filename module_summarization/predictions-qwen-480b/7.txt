Using Lists
===========

Lists in Python are versatile and powerful data structures that allow you to store collections of items. They are ordered, mutable, and can contain elements of different types. This section provides an overview of how to effectively use lists in your code.

Creating Lists
--------------

A list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets ``[]``, separated by commas.

.. code-block:: python

    # Creating an empty list
    empty_list = []

    # Creating a list with integers
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    # Creating a list with mixed data types
    mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]

Accessing List Elements
-----------------------

You can access individual elements in a list using their index. Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first element has an index of 0.

.. code-block:: python

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
    print(fruits[2])  # Output: cherry

Negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the list:

.. code-block:: python

    print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry (last item)
    print(fruits[-2])  # Output: banana (second to last item)

Modifying Lists
---------------

Lists are mutable, so you can change their content without creating a new list.

.. code-block:: python

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    fruits[1] = "blueberry"
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']

Adding Elements
---------------

You can add elements to a list using methods like ``append()``, ``insert()``, or ``extend()``.

.. code-block:: python

    fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
    
    # Append adds an element to the end
    fruits.append("cherry")
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

    # Insert adds an element at a specific position
    fruits.insert(1, "blueberry")
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'cherry']

    # Extend adds multiple elements from another iterable
    fruits.extend(["date", "elderberry"])
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

Removing Elements
-----------------

Elements can be removed from a list using methods such as ``remove()``, ``pop()``, or ``del``.

.. code-block:: python

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

    # Remove the first occurrence of a value
    fruits.remove("banana")
    print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']

    # Pop removes and returns the last item (or a specified index)
    last_fruit = fruits.pop()
    print(last_fruit)  # Output: cherry
    print(fruits)      # Output: ['apple']

    # Del removes an item at a specific index
    del fruits[0]
    print(fruits)  # Output: []

List Comprehensions
-------------------

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a list of squares
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
    print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

    # Create a list of even numbers
    evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
    print(evens)  # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

Iterating Over Lists
--------------------

You can iterate over the elements of a list using a ``for`` loop.

.. code-block:: python

    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)

This will output:

.. code-block:: text

    apple
    banana
    cherry

Common List Methods
-------------------

Here are some commonly used list methods:

- ``append(x)``: Adds an item to the end of the list.
- ``extend(iterable)``: Extends the list by appending all the items from the iterable.
- ``insert(i, x)``: Inserts an item at a given position.
- ``remove(x)``: Removes the first item from the list whose value is equal to x.
- ``pop([i])``: Removes the item at the given position in the list, and returns it. If no index is specified, ``pop()`` removes and returns the last item.
- ``clear()``: Removes all items from the list.
- ``index(x[, start[, end]])``: Returns the index of the first item whose value is equal to x.
- ``count(x)``: Returns the number of times x appears in the list.
- ``sort(key=None, reverse=False)``: Sorts the items of the list in place.
- ``reverse()``: Reverses the elements of the list in place.
- ``copy()``: Returns a shallow copy of the list.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
    numbers.sort()
    print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]

    numbers.reverse()
    print(numbers)  # Output: [9, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]

Conclusion
----------

Lists are fundamental data structures in Python that offer great flexibility for storing and manipulating collections of data. Understanding how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists is essential for effective Python programming.
