w_bins
======

The ``w_bins`` tool provides functionality for displaying information and statistics about binning in a WEST simulation, as well as modifying the binning for the current iteration of a WEST simulation.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    w_bins [-h] [--rcfile RCFILE] {info,rebin} ...

Subcommands
-----------

info
~~~~

Display information about binning.

.. code-block:: bash

    w_bins info [-h] [-n N_ITER] [--detail] [--bins-from-file BINS_FROM_FILE] [--bin-style BIN_STYLE] [--bin-boundaries BIN_BOUNDARIES] [--bin-centers BIN_CENTERS] [--bins-per-dimension BINS_PER_DIMENSION] [--range-per-dimension RANGE_PER_DIMENSION]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n N_ITER, --n-iter N_ITER
                        Consider initial points of segment N_ITER (default: current iteration).
  --detail              Display detailed per-bin information in addition to summary information.
  --bins-from-file BINS_FROM_FILE
                        Load binning specification from a file.
  --bin-style BIN_STYLE
                        Style of binning (e.g., 'rectilinear', 'voronoi').
  --bin-boundaries BIN_BOUNDARIES
                        Boundaries for binning.
  --bin-centers BIN_CENTERS
                        Centers for binning.
  --bins-per-dimension BINS_PER_DIMENSION
                        Number of bins per dimension.
  --range-per-dimension RANGE_PER_DIMENSION
                        Range per dimension for binning.

rebin
~~~~~

Rebuild current iteration with new binning.

.. code-block:: bash

    w_bins rebin [-h] [--confirm] [--detail] [-n N_ITER] [--bins-from-file BINS_FROM_FILE] [--bin-style BIN_STYLE] [--bin-boundaries BIN_BOUNDARIES] [--bin-centers BIN_CENTERS] [--bins-per-dimension BINS_PER_DIMENSION] [--range-per-dimension RANGE_PER_DIMENSION] [--target-counts TARGET_COUNTS]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --confirm             Commit the revised iteration to HDF5; without this option, the effects of the new binning are only calculated and printed.
  --detail              Display detailed per-bin information in addition to summary information.
  -n N_ITER, --n-iter N_ITER
                        Consider initial points of segment N_ITER (default: current iteration).
  --bins-from-file BINS_FROM_FILE
                        Load binning specification from a file.
  --bin-style BIN_STYLE
                        Style of binning (e.g., 'rectilinear', 'voronoi').
  --bin-boundaries BIN_BOUNDARIES
                        Boundaries for binning.
  --bin-centers BIN_CENTERS
                        Centers for binning.
  --bins-per-dimension BINS_PER_DIMENSION
                        Number of bins per dimension.
  --range-per-dimension RANGE_PER_DIMENSION
                        Range per dimension for binning.
  --target-counts TARGET_COUNTS
                        Target counts for bins.

Description
-----------

The ``w_bins`` tool allows users to inspect and modify the binning used in a WESTPA simulation. Binning is a critical component of the weighted ensemble algorithm, as it determines how walkers are distributed across the progress coordinate space.

The ``info`` subcommand displays information about the current binning, including summary statistics and, optionally, detailed per-bin information.

The ``rebin`` subcommand allows users to rebuild the current iteration with a new binning scheme. This can be useful for adjusting the binning strategy during a simulation. By default, the effects of the new binning are only calculated and printed; to commit the changes to the HDF5 file, the ``--confirm`` option must be used.

Examples
--------

Display binning information for the current iteration:

.. code-block:: bash

    w_bins info

Display detailed binning information for iteration 10:

.. code-block:: bash

    w_bins info -n 10 --detail

Rebin the current iteration with new binning (dry run):

.. code-block:: bash

    w_bins rebin --bins-per-dimension 10 10

Rebin the current iteration and commit changes:

.. code-block:: bash

    w_bins rebin --confirm --bins-per-dimension 10 10
```
