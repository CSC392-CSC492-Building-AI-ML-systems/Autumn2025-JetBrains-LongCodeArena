Getting Started with Mitogen
============================

Introduction
------------

Mitogen is a Python library that enables efficient communication and remote execution between Python interpreters. It allows you to run Python code on remote machines or processes with minimal overhead and maximum performance.

This guide will help you get started with Mitogen, covering installation, basic concepts, and simple usage examples.

Installation
------------

To install Mitogen, use pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mitogen

Basic Concepts
--------------

Mitogen operates on several key concepts:

- **Context**: A connection to a remote interpreter or process
- **Broker**: Manages communication between contexts
- **Router**: Handles routing of messages between contexts
- **Master**: The main process that initiates connections

Creating Your First Connection
------------------------------

Here's a simple example to get you started:

.. code-block:: python

    import mitogen
    import mitogen.utils

    @mitogen.utils.run_with_router
    def main(router):
        # Create a connection to a local subprocess
        context = router.local()
        
        # Execute a command on the remote context
        result = context.call(print, "Hello from Mitogen!")
        print("Result:", result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()

Working with Remote Hosts
-------------------------

To connect to a remote SSH host:

.. code-block:: python

    import mitogen
    import mitogen.utils

    @mitogen.utils.run_with_router
    def main(router):
        # Connect to a remote host via SSH
        context = router.ssh(
            hostname='example.com',
            username='your_username',
            password='your_password'  # or use SSH keys
        )
        
        # Run a command on the remote host
        result = context.call(print, "Hello from remote host!")
        print("Remote result:", result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
