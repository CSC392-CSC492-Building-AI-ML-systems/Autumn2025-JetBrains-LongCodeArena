Contracts
=========

The ``web3.contract`` module provides a Python API for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts. It allows you to deploy new contracts, call contract functions, and listen for contract events.

Contract Class
--------------

.. autoclass:: web3.contract.Contract

Creating a Contract Factory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To interact with a smart contract, you first need to create a contract factory using the compiled Solidity contract ABI definitions. This factory will be a subclass of the base ``Contract`` class.

Deploying a Contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can deploy a new smart contract using the ``deploy`` class method:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> MyContract.deploy(
        transaction={
            'from': web3.eth.accounts[1],
            'value': 12345,
        },
        args=('DGD', 18),
    )
    '0x5c504ed432cb51138bcf09aa5e8a410dd4a1e204ef84bfed1be16dfba1b22060'

Interacting with a Deployed Contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To interact with an existing deployed contract, create a contract proxy object by initializing the contract factory with the contract's address:

.. code-block:: python

    my_contract = MyContract(address='0x...')

Encoding ABI
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``encodeABI`` method encodes the arguments using the Ethereum ABI for the contract function that matches the given name and arguments.

Events
~~~~~~

You can register callbacks to be triggered on specific contract events using the ``on`` method.
