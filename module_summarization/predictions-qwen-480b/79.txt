========================

.. automodule:: classfiles
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:

This module provides functionality to read GILDAS CLASS files into a format compatible with `pyspeckit`. The main purpose is to convert observational data stored in CLASS files into an :class:`pyspeckit.spectrum.ObsBlock` object for further analysis.

Key Features
------------

- Reads various versions and formats of CLASS files
- Handles both single and multiple spectrum files
- Converts GILDAS-specific data structures into standard Python objects
- Provides timing utilities for performance monitoring

Main Functions
--------------

.. autofunction:: print_timing

.. autofunction:: ensure_bytes

Data Structures
---------------

The module defines several dictionaries and mappings to handle the different file formats and header structures used in CLASS files:

- `filetype_dict`: Maps file type codes to descriptive names
- `fileversion_dict`: Maps file version codes to version identifiers  
- `record_lengths`: Defines record lengths for different file types
- `header_id_numbers`: Maps header ID numbers to section names
- `header_id_lengths`: Defines expected lengths for different header sections

The module also includes detailed specifications for the GENERAL header section structure, including observation metadata like telescope information, observation dates, coordinates, and system parameters.

Dependencies
------------

- astropy
- numpy
- pyspeckit
- six (for Python 2/3 compatibility)

The module includes compatibility handling for different Python versions and provides progress bar functionality when available.
