Random Projection
=================

.. currentmodule:: sklearn.random_projection

Random Projection is a simple and computationally efficient way to reduce the dimensionality of the data by trading a controlled amount of accuracy (as additional variance) for faster processing times and smaller model sizes.

The dimensions and distribution of Random Projection matrices are controlled so as to preserve the pairwise distances between any two samples of the dataset.

The main theoretical result behind the efficiency of random projection is the
`Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma>`_:

  In mathematics, the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is a result
  concerning low-distortion embeddings of points from high-dimensional
  into low-dimensional Euclidean space. The lemma states that a small set
  of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of
  much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are
  nearly preserved. The map used for the embedding is at least Lipschitz,
  and can even be taken to be an orthogonal projection.
