Data Component in an Image HDU
==============================

The data component of an Image HDU (Header/Data Unit) represents the actual pixel values stored in the FITS file. This component is typically a multidimensional array of numerical data, such as integers or floating-point numbers, which may represent anything from astronomical images to data cubes.

In the context of FITS files, the data is stored in binary format following the header information. The structure and type of the data array are described by keywords in the header, such as `NAXIS`, `BITPIX`, and `CTYPE`.

The data component is accessible through the `.data` attribute of an Image HDU object. This attribute returns a NumPy array, allowing for efficient manipulation and analysis using standard Python tools.

Example
-------

To access the data component of an Image HDU:

```python
from astropy.io import fits

with fits.open('image.fits') as hdul:
    image_data = hdul[0].data
    print(image_data.shape)
```

This will output the dimensions of the image array, such as `(1024, 1024)` for a 1024x1024 pixel image.

Verification
------------

The data component supports verification through various options that control how potential issues are handled:

- ``ignore``: Ignore all verification issues.
- ``warn``: Issue warnings for verification problems.
- ``exception``: Raise exceptions for verification problems.
- ``fix``: Attempt to fix issues and report results.
- ``silentfix``: Fix issues silently without reporting.
- Combinations like ``fix+warn`` or ``silentfix+exception`` are also supported.

Verification ensures that the data conforms to FITS standards and can help identify potential issues with the file structure or content.
