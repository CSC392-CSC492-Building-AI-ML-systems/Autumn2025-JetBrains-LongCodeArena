File Objects
============

In ``h5py``, File Objects serve as the primary interface for interacting with HDF5 files. These objects encapsulate the functionality required to open, close, and manage HDF5 files, providing access to the hierarchical structure of groups and datasets stored within.

Each File Object is associated with a low-level identifier, managed through the ``ObjectID`` base class, which ensures proper resource handling and synchronization in multithreaded environments. The ``ObjectID`` class maintains a registry of live object identifiers to prevent issues with "zombie" identifiers that can occur when HDF5 reuses closed identifier values.

Key features of File Objects include:

- **Thread Safety**: Access to the low-level HDF5 API is serialized using a recursive lock to prevent concurrent access that could lead to inconsistent states.
- **Identifier Management**: The object identifier registry tracks all live ``ObjectID`` instances, automatically invalidating stale identifiers when necessary to avoid referencing incorrect objects.
- **Resource Cleanup**: File Objects handle reference counting and proper cleanup of HDF5 resources, ensuring that identifiers are decremented and resources are released when no longer needed.

File Objects also provide properties and methods for checking the validity of the file handle and retrieving file-specific information, such as the file's unique identifier within the HDF5 library.
