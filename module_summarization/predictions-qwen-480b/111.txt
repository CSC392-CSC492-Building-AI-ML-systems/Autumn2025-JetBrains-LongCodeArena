Plans
=====

This module provides a set of predefined plans for controlling experimental procedures in the Bluesky framework. These plans are used to orchestrate the movement of motors, acquisition of data from detectors, and other experimental actions.

Plans
-----

.. autofunction:: count

.. autofunction:: list_scan

.. autofunction:: rel_list_scan

Each plan is a generator function that yields a sequence of messages. These messages are interpreted by the Bluesky RunEngine to perform the desired experimental procedure.

The `count` plan is used to take one or more readings from a list of detectors. The `list_scan` plan is used to scan over one or more variables in steps simultaneously. The `rel_list_scan` plan is used to scan over one variable in steps relative to the current position.
