Multiclass and Multioutput Algorithms

Introduction
------------

Scikit-learn provides tools to extend single-output machine learning algorithms to support multiclass and multioutput tasks. These tools are particularly useful when dealing with problems where each sample can belong to multiple classes or when predicting multiple target variables simultaneously.

Multiclass Classification
-------------------------

Multiclass classification is the problem of classifying instances into one of three or more classes. Scikit-learn provides several strategies to handle multiclass classification:

1. **One-vs-Rest (OvR)**: Also known as one-vs-all, this strategy consists of fitting one classifier per class. For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other classes. In addition to its computational efficiency (only `n_classes` classifiers are needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability. Since each class is represented by one and one classifier only, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier.

2. **One-vs-One (OvO)**: This strategy consists of fitting one classifier for each pair of classes. At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected. In the event of a tie (among two classes with an equal number of votes), it selects the class with the highest aggregate classification confidence, where the confidence of a classification is the sum of the confidence estimates of all the binary classifiers that predicted that class.

3. **Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC)**: This strategy uses a coding book to represent each class with a unique binary code. The length of the code is called the code size. A data point is classified by concatenating the predictions of the binary classifiers and selecting the class whose code is most similar to the predicted code.

Multioutput Regression
----------------------

Multioutput regression aims to predict multiple (real-valued) target variables simultaneously. This is different from running separate regression models for each target variable, as it allows for potential correlations between the targets to be taken into account.

The :class:`MultiOutputRegressor` meta-estimator supports multioutput regression by fitting one regressor per target. This estimator provides a simple strategy for extending regressors that do not natively support multioutput targets.

Multioutput Classification
--------------------------

Multioutput classification aims to predict multiple (nominal) target variables simultaneously. This is different from running separate classification models for each target variable, as it allows for potential correlations between the targets to be taken into account.

The :class:`MultiOutputClassifier` meta-estimator supports multioutput classification by fitting one classifier per target. This estimator provides a simple strategy for extending classifiers that do not natively support multioutput targets.

Classifier Chains
-----------------

Classifier chains are a way of combining multiple binary classifiers to solve multi-label classification problems. In this strategy, each classifier is trained on the input features as well as the predictions of the previous classifiers in the chain. This allows the classifiers to exploit correlations between the labels.

The :class:`ClassifierChain` meta-estimator implements this strategy. It builds a chain of binary classifiers where each classifier is trained on the input features and the predictions of the previous classifiers in the chain.

Regressor Chains
----------------

Regressor chains are a way of combining multiple regressors to solve multioutput regression problems. In this strategy, each regressor is trained on the input features as well as the predictions of the previous regressors in the chain. This allows the regressors to exploit correlations between the targets.

The :class:`RegressorChain` meta-estimator implements this strategy. It builds a chain of regressors where each regressor is trained on the input features and the predictions of the previous regressors in the chain.
