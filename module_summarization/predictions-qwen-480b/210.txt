Empirical Likelihood
====================

Empirical likelihood inference on descriptive statistics

This module conducts hypothesis tests and constructs confidence
intervals for the mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis and correlation.

If matplotlib is installed, this module can also generate multivariate
confidence region plots as well as mean-variance contour plots.

See _OptFuncts docstring for technical details and optimization variable
definitions.

Technical Details
-----------------

The general setup of the _OptFuncts class is simple. Any method that starts with
_opt_ creates a vector of estimating equations named est_vect such that
np.dot(p, (est_vect))=0 where p is the weight on each observation as a 1 x n
array and est_vect is n x k. Then _modif_Newton is called to determine the
optimal p by solving for the Lagrange multiplier (eta) in the profile
likelihood maximization problem. In the presence of nuisance parameters,
_opt_ functions are optimized over to profile out the nuisance parameters.

Any method starting with _ci_limits calculates the log likelihood ratio for
a specific value of a parameter and then subtracts a pre-specified critical
value. This is solved so that llr - crit = 0.
