Nonparametric Methods
=====================

Nonparametric methods in statistics are techniques that do not rely on data belonging to any particular parametric family of probability distributions. These methods are particularly useful when the underlying distribution of the data is unknown or does not fit standard parametric assumptions. Nonparametric methods are often more flexible and robust, making fewer assumptions about the data.

Kernel Density Estimation
--------------------------

Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a nonparametric way to estimate the probability density function of a random variable. The KDE is a fundamental tool in nonparametric statistics and is used for density estimation, data smoothing, and visualization.

Univariate Kernel Density Estimator
-----------------------------------

The `KDEUnivariate` class provides a univariate kernel density estimator. It is particularly efficient for univariate, continuous data due to its FFT-based implementation. This class supports various kernels and bandwidth selection methods.

.. class:: KDEUnivariate(endog)

   Univariate Kernel Density Estimator.

   :param endog: The variable for which the density estimate is desired.

   .. method:: fit(kernel='gau', bw='normal_reference', fft=True, weights=None, gridsize=None, adjust=1, cut=3, clip=(-np.inf, np.inf))

      Attach the density estimate to the KDEUnivariate class.

      :param kernel: The Kernel to be used. Choices are:
                     - "biw" for biweight
                     - "cos" for cosine
                     - "epa" for Epanechnikov
                     - "gau" for Gaussian
                     - "tri" for triangular
                     - "triw" for triweight
                     - "uni" for uniform
      :param bw: The bandwidth to use. Choices are:
                 - "scott" - 1.059 * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where A is `min(std(x),IQR/1.34)`
                 - "silverman" - .9 * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where A is `min(std(x),IQR/1.34)`
                 - "normal_reference" - C * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where C is calculated from the kernel
                 - If a float is given, its value is used as the bandwidth
                 - If a callable is given, it's return value is used
      :param fft: Whether or not to use FFT. FFT implementation is more computationally efficient. However, only the Gaussian kernel is implemented.
      :param gridsize: If gridsize is None, max(len(x), 50) is used.
      :param cut: Defines the length of the grid past the lowest and highest values of x so that the kernel goes to zero.
      :param adjust: An adjustment factor for the bw. Bandwidth becomes bw * adjust.

   .. method:: cdf

      Returns the cumulative distribution function evaluated at the support.
