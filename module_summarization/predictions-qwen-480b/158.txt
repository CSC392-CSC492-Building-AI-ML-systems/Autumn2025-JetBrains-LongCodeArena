Migrating to nextcord
=====================

This guide provides information on migrating your codebase from using discord.py to nextcord, a fork of discord.py that continues active development and support.

Introduction
------------

nextcord is a powerful Python library for interacting with the Discord API. It is a fork of discord.py, which was archived and is no longer maintained. nextcord continues to provide the same functionality while adding new features and improvements.

Key Differences
---------------

1. **Package Name**: The most significant change is the package name. Replace all imports from `discord` to `nextcord`.

   Before:
   ```python
   import discord
   from discord.ext import commands
   ```

   After:
   ```python
   import nextcord
   from nextcord.ext import commands
   ```

2. **Installation**: Update your installation command to use nextcord.

   Before:
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py
   ```

   After:
   ```bash
   pip install nextcord
   ```

3. **API Compatibility**: nextcord maintains API compatibility with discord.py, so most of your existing code should work without modification.

Migration Steps
---------------

1. **Update Imports**: Replace all instances of `discord` with `nextcord` in your codebase.

2. **Update Dependencies**: Update your `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` to use nextcord instead of discord.py.

3. **Test Your Bot**: Run your bot to ensure all functionality works as expected. Report any issues to the nextcord GitHub repository.

4. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation or README files to reflect the change to nextcord.

Additional Features
-------------------

nextcord includes several enhancements over discord.py, including:

- Active development and bug fixes
- Support for newer Discord features
- Improved performance and stability
- Enhanced documentation and examples

Conclusion
