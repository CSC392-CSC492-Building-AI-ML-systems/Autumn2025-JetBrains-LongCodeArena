Biclustering
============

Biclustering is a data mining technique that simultaneously clusters both the rows and columns of a matrix. Unlike traditional clustering methods that group either rows (samples) or columns (features) independently, biclustering identifies submatrices (biclusters) with coherent patterns. These patterns can be homogeneous values, constant rows or columns, or coherent evolutions in time series data.

Applications
------------

Biclustering is particularly useful in:

- **Gene expression analysis**: Finding groups of genes that exhibit similar expression levels under subsets of experimental conditions.
- **Market basket analysis**: Identifying groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviors across subsets of products.
- **Recommendation systems**: Discovering user-item interaction patterns to improve recommendations.
- **Text mining**: Grouping documents and words that frequently co-occur.

Algorithms
----------

Several biclustering algorithms exist, each designed to detect specific types of patterns:

1. **Spectral Biclustering**: Assumes that the input data matrix can be rearranged to form block-diagonal or checkerboard structures. It uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to find row and column clusters.

2. **Co-clustering**: Models the data as a mixture of distributions and uses an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach to iteratively optimize row and column cluster assignments.

3. **Plaid Model**: Assumes that the data can be represented as a superposition of biclusters with additive effects. It fits multiple layers to capture overlapping biclusters.

4. **Cheng and Church's Algorithm**: Designed for finding biclusters with mean squared residue close to zero, indicating coherent values.

5. **ISA (Iterative Signature Algorithm)**: Iteratively refines row and column signatures to find biclusters with coherent patterns.

Key Concepts
------------

- **Bicluster**: A submatrix defined by a subset of rows and columns that exhibit coherent behavior.
- **Coherency**: The measure of similarity or consistency within a bicluster. Different algorithms define coherency differently (e.g., constant values, additive effects).
- **Overlapping Biclusters**: Some algorithms allow rows or columns to belong to multiple biclusters, reflecting real-world scenarios where entities can participate in multiple patterns.

Parameters
----------

Biclustering algorithms typically involve parameters such as:

- **Number of biclusters**: The expected number of biclusters to find.
- **Coherency threshold**: A measure of how coherent the values within a bicluster must be.
- **Convergence criteria**: Conditions under which the algorithm stops iterating.
