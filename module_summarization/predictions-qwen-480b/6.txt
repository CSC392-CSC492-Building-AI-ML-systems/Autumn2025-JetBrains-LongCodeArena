Working with User Security Roles
================================

In ftrack, user security roles define the permissions and access levels that users have within the system. These roles are essential for maintaining security and ensuring that users can only perform actions and access data appropriate to their responsibilities.

Overview
--------

Security roles in ftrack are predefined sets of permissions that can be assigned to users or groups. Each role encapsulates a collection of rights that determine what a user can do within the system, such as:

- Viewing, creating, or modifying projects
- Accessing specific types of data or entities
- Performing administrative tasks
- Publishing or reviewing content

Roles can be assigned at different levels, including globally across the entire ftrack instance or specifically to individual projects.

Managing Security Roles
-----------------------

Security roles can be managed programmatically through the ftrack API. Users with appropriate permissions can create, modify, and assign roles to ensure proper access control.

### Assigning Roles

Roles are typically assigned to users through the ftrack web interface or via API calls that associate a user with a specific role on a project or system level.

### Creating Custom Roles

Administrators can create custom roles that define specific permissions tailored to their pipeline needs. These roles can then be assigned to users or groups as needed.

### Role Inheritance

In ftrack, roles can be inherited. For example, a user assigned to a group that has a specific role will inherit the permissions associated with that role, unless explicitly overridden.

Best Practices
--------------

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign users the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties.
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review role assignments to ensure they are still appropriate.
- **Use Groups**: Assign roles to groups rather than individual users when possible to simplify management.
- **Custom Roles**: Create custom roles for specific workflows rather than over-privileging standard roles.

By properly configuring and managing security roles, you can ensure a secure and efficient workflow environment in ftrack.
