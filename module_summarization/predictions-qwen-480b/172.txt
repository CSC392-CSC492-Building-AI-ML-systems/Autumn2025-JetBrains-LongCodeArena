SANS to SESANS Conversion
=========================

This documentation provides an overview of the conversion process from Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) data to Spin-Echo Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SESANS) data. The conversion involves transforming the scattering intensity data into a correlation function that represents the spatial correlations in the sample.

Conversion Process
------------------

The SANS to SESANS conversion is based on the following mathematical relationship:

.. math::

    G(z) = \frac{1}{\Sigma} \int_0^\infty J_0(qz) \frac{d\Sigma}{dq} dq

Where:
- :math:`G(z)` is the SESANS correlation function
- :math:`J_0` is the zeroth-order Bessel function
- :math:`q` is the scattering vector
- :math:`z` is the spin-echo length
- :math:`\Sigma` is the total scattering cross-section

Implementation Details
----------------------

The conversion process involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: SANS data is first processed to ensure proper normalization and background subtraction.

2. **Hankel Transform**: The core of the conversion is the Hankel transform, which converts the SANS intensity data to the SESANS correlation function.

3. **Integration**: Numerical integration is performed over the available q-range to compute the correlation function at various spin-echo lengths.

4. **Normalization**: The resulting correlation function is normalized by the total scattering cross-section.

Parameters
----------

The conversion process uses several parameters that control the transformation:

volume
~~~~~~
Parameters related to the volume of the scattering objects, used in models that require size-dependent calculations.

orientation
~~~~~~~~~~~
Parameters describing the orientation distribution of anisotropic particles in the sample.

sld
~~~
Scattering length density parameters that define the contrast between different materials in the sample.

none
~~~~
Parameters that don't fall into the above categories but are still relevant for the conversion process.

Usage
-----

To perform SANS to SESANS conversion, ensure that your SANS data is properly formatted with scattering intensity as a function of scattering vector q. The conversion algorithm will then generate the corresponding SESANS correlation function G(z) over a specified range of spin-echo lengths.

The conversion is particularly useful for studying:
- Porous materials
- Colloidal suspensions
- Biological samples
- Thin films and surfaces

The resulting SESANS data provides direct information about real-space correlations in the sample, making it complementary to traditional SANS measurements.
