Generate documentation for this code
====================================

This module constructs a dynamic reStructuredText document describing the available Meijer G functions. The generated content is produced at import time and exposed as a module docstring, suitable for inclusion in Sphinx.

How it works
- A lookup table t is created and populated by _create_lookup_table(t).
- The table is iterated in a stable order using default_sort_key.
- If a category key is the empty tuple, the section is titled "Elementary functions".
- Otherwise, sections are titled "Functions involving …" where the function heads are rendered in LaTeX.
- For each entry (formula, gs, cond, hint) in a category:
  - If gs is not a list, g is set to Symbol('\text{generated}'); otherwise g is Add(*[fac*f for (fac, f) in gs]).
  - The equation obj is constructed as Eq(formula, g).
  - If cond is True, no condition is appended; otherwise a condition is appended as ",\text{ if } <latex(cond)>".
  - Each entry is emitted as a math directive:
    .. math::
      <latex(obj)><cond>

Output
- The final content is assigned to __doc__ and can be rendered by Sphinx as part of the documentation.
