Using Custom Attributes
=======================

Custom attributes provide user-defined metadata that can be attached to ftrack entities (for example, shots, tasks, or other trackable items). They extend the built‑in data model with domain‑specific fields and constraints, allowing you to store additional information and drive workflows, validations, and reporting.

Overview
--------
- Custom attributes are defined per entity type and can have various data types (string, integer, boolean, date, selection, etc.) and constraints.
- The ftrack_api.attribute module is used to discover custom attribute definitions and to work with their metadata.
- Values for custom attributes are read from and written to individual entity instances. Changes are persisted to the server as part of normal session operations.

Accessing custom attribute definitions
--------------------------------------
- Retrieve the definitions for a given entity type to understand what attributes exist, their data types, and any constraints.
- Definitions include:
  - Attribute name or key
  - Data type (e.g., string, integer, date, boolean, selection)
  - Allowed values or value constraints
  - Applicable entity types and contexts

Reading custom attribute values
-------------------------------
- For a given entity instance, you can access the current values of its custom attributes.
- Reading values is typically performed via the entity’s custom attributes container or through a dedicated accessor provided by the API.
- Values reflect the data stored on the server for that particular entity and can be used for display, filtering, or decision making.

Writing custom attribute values
-------------------------------
- To set or update a custom attribute value, assign the desired value to the corresponding attribute on the entity.
- The API will validate the value against the attribute’s type and constraints before persisting it to the server.
- Once set, the value becomes part of the entity’s data and will be available to other users and processes that access the entity.

Best practices and considerations
-------------------------------
- Validate values against the attribute’s data type and constraints to avoid server-side validation errors.
- Consider caching metadata (schema) to minimize repeated server requests when working with many entities or frequent reads of attribute definitions.
- Be mindful of permissions: some custom attributes may be read-only for certain users or require specific project permissions to modify.
- Use descriptive attribute names and, where applicable, clear allowed value sets to improve usability and data quality.
- Document usage patterns in your project to ensure consistent application of custom attributes across workflows.
