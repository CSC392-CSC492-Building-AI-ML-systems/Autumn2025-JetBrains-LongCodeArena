Cross Decomposition
===================

Overview
--------
Cross decomposition (Partial Least Squares, PLS) provides a family of methods to model the relationship between two data matrices:
- X: predictors (shape n_samples x n_features)
- Y: responses (shape n_samples x n_targets)

The goal is to extract latent variables (scores) that capture the covariance between X and Y. This yields dimensionality reduction and, for some variants, predictive models.

Algorithms
----------
The module implements three related estimators:

- PLSRegression
  - Purpose: Regress Y from X by projecting both onto a sequence of latent components that maximize the covariance between X and Y.
  - Behavior: Iteratively deflates X and Y after extracting each component. Produces regression coefficients to predict Y from new X.
  - Key outputs: x_weights_, x_loadings_, y_loadings_, x_scores_, y_scores_, coef_.

- PLSCanonical
  - Purpose: A symmetric cross-decomposition that finds components maximizing covariance between X and Y without a direct predictor–response interpretation.
  - Behavior: Similar extraction of latent structures in both X and Y, suitable for discovering shared structure.

- PLSSVD
  - Purpose: Based on the singular value decomposition of X^T Y. Decomposes X and Y into rank-one components that maximize cross-covariance.
  - Use: Exploratory analysis and dimensionality reduction of the relation between X and Y.

Centering and scaling
---------------------
All methods center X and Y before extraction. Optional scaling (standardization of features to unit variance) is available. Centering and scaling are handled by internal utilities (e.g., _center_scale_xy).

Computation details
-------------------
- The first latent vectors can be computed either via full SVD of X^T Y or via a power-method approach.
  - Power method: _get_first_singular_vectors_power_method
  - SVD: _get_first_singular_vectors_svd
- Internal validation and preprocessing utilities ensure consistent inputs and outputs.
