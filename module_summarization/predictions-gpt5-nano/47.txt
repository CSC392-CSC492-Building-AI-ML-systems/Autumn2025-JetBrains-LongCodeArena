Contingency Tables (two-way)

Overview
========
Utilities for analyzing two-way contingency tables (frequency tables cross-classified by two categorical variables). The primary focus is on inference for independence and association between the two factors, with support for nominal and ordinal data as well as related convenience utilities.

Public API
===========
Classes and functions documented in this module (as exposed in the imported namespace):

- Table
  - __init__(table, shift_zeros=True)
    - Initialize a two-way contingency table. Optionally shift zero counts by 0.5 if any cell is zero.
  - from_data(cls, data, shift_zeros=True)
    - Construct a Table from raw data by creating a contingency table from the first two columns using pandas.crosstab.
  - __str__()
    - String representation showing the table shape and contents.
  - test_nominal_association(self)
    - Assess independence for nominal factors via a chi-squared test. Returns a _Bunch with attributes:
      - statistic: float
      - df: integer
      - pvalue: float
  - test_ordinal_association(self, row_scores=None, col_scores=None)
    - Assess dependence for ordinal factors using a linear-by-linear (Cochran–Armitage–type) test. Optional row/column scores may be provided; defaults to 0..n-1. Returns a _Bunch with attributes including statistic, null_mean, null_sd, zscore, pvalue.
- _Bunch
  - A lightweight container used to store test results. Provides readable representations via __repr__ and __str__.
- _make_df_square(table)
  - Private helper to reindex a pandas DataFrame into a square matrix when possible, aligning row and column indices and filling missing cells with zeros.
Notes
-----
- The implemented tests are designed under a framework where observations are independently and identically distributed (iid). The exact sampling model affects inference.
- The module also references (in its top-level documentation) additional related classes for specialized use:
  - SquareTable
  - Table2x2
  - StratifiedTable
  - Functions for McNemar’s test and Cochran’s q test
  These provide extended capabilities for specific table shapes or study designs.

Usage examples
--------------
- Build a Table from a 2D array:
  table = Table([[10, 2, 0], [1, 7, 3]])
  res = table.test_nominal_association()
  print(res.pvalue)

- Build a Table from data:
  tbl = Table.from_data(data_frame_or_array)

- Ordinal association with default scores:
  res_ord = table.test_ordinal_association()
  print(res_ord.pvalue)
