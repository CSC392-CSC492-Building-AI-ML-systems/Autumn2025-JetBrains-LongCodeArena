Library conventions
===================

Overview
--------

This library follows Pythonic conventions for scientific computing, with an emphasis on clear public APIs, well-formed docstrings, and consistent module structure. Public behaviors are documented in a NumPy/SciPy-inspired style and designed to be accessible from within the package’s namespace.

Licensing and Copyright
-----------------------

- Source files begin with a copyright and licensing block, describing permitted uses, conditions, and disclaimers.
- Redistributions and derivative works are allowed under the stated terms, with attribution and preservation of the license text.
- Author and date information are included in the header where practical, aiding attribution and historical context.

Public API conventions
----------------------

- Public symbols intended for external use are declared via __all__ in each module, listing only the public API.
  - Example: in module dtime.py, __all__ = ['sample_system', 'c2d'].
  - Public classes, functions, and constants should be importable from the package without requiring internal modules.
- Public API objects should have clear, stable semantics and documented behavior in their docstrings.

Docstring and documentation conventions
---------------------------------------

- Docstrings follow the NumPy/SciPy style:
  - Sections include Parameters, Returns, Notes, and Examples.
  - Cross-references use Sphinx roles, e.g. :class:`StateSpace`, :class:`TransferFunction`, :func:`sample_system`.
- Examples should be doctest-friendly and demonstrate typical usage, including simple end-to-end snippets.
- Module docstrings describe the module’s purpose and list notable routines (functions/classes) it provides.
- Docstrings should be complete and informative, covering input validation, return types, and edge cases where relevant.

Module structure and naming
---------------------------

- Each module begins with a concise module docstring describing its purpose and major routines.
- Functions and classes follow descriptive, consistent naming that reflects their role and relationships (e.g., sample_system, c2d).
- Internal helpers remain private (prefixed with an underscore) when they are not intended for public use.

Testing and examples
--------------------

- Doctests are encouraged in Examples sections of docstrings to illustrate usage and expected results.
- Unit tests should exercise public APIs and verify expected behaviors, including error handling and boundary cases.
- Cross-module references in docstrings should remain valid as long as public APIs are preserved.

Versioning and attribution
--------------------------

- Documentation and headers should reflect authorship where appropriate and preserve historical context.
- Public API changes should be managed to minimize breaking changes; deprecations should be announced with a clear transition path.

Notes on the library’s conventions
----------------------------------

- The library targets Python 3 with dependencies on SciPy/NumPy-compatible types and interfaces (e.g., LTI representations like StateSpace or TransferFunction).
- Time-domain utilities (e.g., sampling a continuous-time system) are expressed with well-documented function signatures and consistent parameter naming (e.g., Ts for sampling time, method for conversion approach).
- Copyright and licensing text should be preserved in redistributed sources to maintain compliance with the original terms.
