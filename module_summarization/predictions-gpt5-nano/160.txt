Compatibility Policy
====================

Overview
--------

This document describes the compatibility guarantees for the public Python API, binary/ABI interfaces, and extension modules of the project, including the numpy.random package and its C extensions (e.g., npyrandom).

Public API stability
--------------------

- The public Python API is designed to remain stable across minor releases.
- Existing function signatures, documented behaviors, and exception types should not change.
- New features may be added in a backward-compatible manner.

Deprecations and removals
-------------------------

- Deprecated APIs will emit a DeprecationWarning.
- Deprecated features are announced in release notes and documentation.
- Removal of deprecated APIs will occur in a future major release, with migration guidance provided.

Binary compatibility and C extensions
-------------------------------------

- Binary compatibility of compiled extensions is maintained within the same interpreter family (e.g., same Python major/minor version) as long as the interpreter ABI remains compatible.
- Breaking changes to the C API or extension interface will be accompanied by a major version bump and migration guidance.
- Changes requiring rebuilds or repackage of binary wheels will be communicated clearly in release notes.

Versioning and releases
------------------------

- Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
- Breaking changes are reserved for MAJOR releases.
- Backwards-compatible bug fixes and small feature additions go into MINOR or PATCH releases as appropriate.

Platform and interpreter support
-------------------------------

- Supported platforms include major Unix-like systems, Windows, and macOS.
- Supported Python interpreters are the versions explicitly listed in the project’s release notes; dropping support for older interpreters will be announced in advance.

Migration guidance
------------------

- When breaking changes are introduced, migration notes explain:
  - What changed
  - Why the change was necessary
  - How to adapt existing code
  - Any alternative APIs or patterns

Testing and validation
----------------------

- Compatibility tests cover public APIs across supported Python versions and platforms.
- CI runs validate API stability and binary compatibility where feasible.

Reporting compatibility issues
------------------------------

- Report any incompatibilities with reproducible examples, including:
  - Python version
  - Platform/OS
  - Compiler information (for binary extensions)
  - Exact API or behavior that diverges
- Issues should reference the relevant release notes if applicable.
