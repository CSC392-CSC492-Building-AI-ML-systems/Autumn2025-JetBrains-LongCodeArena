w_multi_west
==============

Overview
--------

Tool designed to combine multiple WESTPA simulations while accounting for reweighting.

Command-line interface
----------------------

The following options are available:

- -o, --output-file
  The name of the output file to store results in. Default: multi.h5

- -W, --west, --WEST_H5FILE
  The name of the main.h5 file inside each simulation directory. Default: west.h5

- -a, --aux
  Names of additional auxiliary datasets to be combined

- -aa, --auxall
  Combine all auxiliary datasets. Default: False

- -nr, --no-reweight
  Do not reweight. Default: False

- -ib, --ibstates
  Attempt to combine ibstates dataset. Default: False

Notes
-----

- The tool creates and writes to a single output HDF5 file containing the combined results.
- Progress is reported via a ProgressIndicatorComponent.
- By default, reweighting is applied unless the --no-reweight flag is specified.
- Auxiliary datasets can be selectively included with -a or all datasets with -aa.
- Optional ibstates support can be enabled with -ib.

Examples
--------

- Basic usage:
  w_multi_west -o multi.h5 -W west.h5

- Include specific auxiliary datasets:
  w_multi_west -o multi.h5 -W west.h5 -a traj_extents -a other_aux

- Include all auxiliaries and disable reweighting:
  w_multi_west -o multi.h5 -W west.h5 -aa -nr

- Enable ibstates merging:
  w_multi_west -o multi.h5 -W west.h5 -ib
