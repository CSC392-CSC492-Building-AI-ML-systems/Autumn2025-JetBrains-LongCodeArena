w_init
======

Initialize a new WESTPA simulation, creating the WEST HDF5 file and preparing the first iteration’s segments.

Overview
--------
w_init processes basis states, target states, and start states to seed the first WESTPA iteration. It creates or updates the working WESTPA run, and initializes the initial segments according to the specified states. If no basis states are provided, a default basis state with probability one (state ID 0, label "basis") will be created (a warning is printed). If no target states are provided, an equilibrium simulation (no sinks) will be performed.

Usage
-----
w_init [options]

Options
-------
--force
  Overwrite any existing simulation data.

--bstate-file, --bstates-from BSTATE_FILE
  Read basis state names, probabilities, and (optionally) data references from BSTATE_FILE.

--bstate
  Add a given basis state (specified as a string 'label,probability[,auxref]') to the list of basis states. This may be specified multiple times; states are appended in the order given on the command line.

--tstate-file, --tstates-from TSTATE_FILE
  Read target state names and representative progress coordinates from TSTATE_FILE. WESTPA uses the representative progress coordinate of a target state and converts the entire bin containing that progress coordinate into a recycling sink.

--tstate
  Add a given target state (specified as a string 'label,pcoord0[,pcoord1[,...]]') to the list of target states. This may be specified multiple times; states are appended in the order they appear on the command line.

--sstate-file, --sstates-from SSTATE_FILE
  Read start state names, probabilities, and (optionally) data references from SSTATE_FILE.

--sstate
  Add the given start state (specified as a string 'label,probability[,auxref]') to the list of start states. This may be specified multiple times; states are appended in the order given on the command line.

--segs-per-state, -N
  Initialize N segments from each basis state (default: 1).

--no-we, --shotgun
  Do not run the weighted ensemble bin/split/merge algorithm on newly-created segments.

Notes on behavior
-----------------
- Basis states: If neither --bstates-from nor --bstate is provided, a single default basis state with probability 1 is created (label "basis", ID 0). A warning is printed to remind you of this behavior.
- Target states: If neither a tstate file nor any --tstate arguments are provided, WESTPA will perform an equilibrium simulation (no sinks).
- Start states: Start states (sstates) are optional and may be supplied from a file or on the command line; they seed the initial distribution of segments.
- Processing flow: The command builds lists of target_states, basis_states, and start_states, then initializes the WESTPA run using the selected work manager.

Examples
--------
1) Basic initialization with defaults (equilibrium run, default basis state):
   w_init

2) Initialize with explicit basis state and a target state for a non-equilibrium setup:
   w_init --bstate "start,1.0" --tstate "sink,0.0"

3) Initialize with multiple basis and start states from files, and seed with segmentation count per state:
   w_init --bstates-from basis.txt --sstates-from starts.txt --segs-per-state 2

Files and parsing
-----------------
- Basis states from file or command line strings are parsed into BasisState objects.
- Target states from file or command line strings are parsed into TargetState objects; tstate handling converts the specified progress coordinate into a recycling sink.
- Start states from file or command line strings are parsed into BasisState objects and used to seed the initial segments.
