Biclustering
==============

Biclustering (also known as co-clustering) is the simultaneous clustering of rows and columns in a data matrix to find submatrices (biclusters) that exhibit coherent patterns. Unlike traditional clustering, which assigns each row (or column) to a single cluster, biclustering discovers local structures where specific subsets of rows co-vary with specific subsets of columns.

Why use biclustering
---------------------
- Detect local patterns that may be hidden when considering the full feature set.
- Useful for gene expression data, user-item interaction data, or any domain where subgroups of entities interact under a subset of conditions.
- Can reveal interpretable submatrices such as constant, additive, or more complex patterns within the data.

Common approaches (as implemented in scikit-learn)
---------------------------------------------------
- SpectralBiclustering
  - An algorithm based on spectral co-clustering to uncover checkerboard-like biclusters.
  - Finds groups of rows and columns that form coherent submatrices.
  - Produces a set of row and column clusters that define the biclusters.

- Spectral Coclustering
  - Similar to SpectralBiclustering but focused on a coclustering perspective.
  - Emphasizes finding simultaneous row and column clusters with a checkerboard structure.

API and usage (high level)
----------------------------
- Estimators implement a fit(X) method (and often fit_transform(X)) to identify biclusters in the input data X.
- After fitting, the estimator exposes row and column clustering information, typically as:
  - rows_: row clustering results (membership of rows to biclusters)
  - columns_: column clustering results (membership of columns to biclusters)
- Parameters commonly include:
  - n_clusters: number of biclusters (or a pair specifying the number of row and column clusters)
  - random_state: for reproducibility
  - method, n_init, and other algorithm-specific options depending on the concrete estimator

Interpretation of results
-------------------------
- Each bicluster corresponds to a subset of rows and a subset of columns where a coherent pattern is observed.
- The row and column membership matrices describe which rows and columns belong to each bicluster.
- Visual inspection or downstream analysis can be applied to interpret the detected patterns.

Example (pseudo-code)
---------------------
from sklearn.cluster import SpectralBiclustering

# X is a numeric data matrix (n_samples x n_features)
model = SpectralBiclustering(n_clusters=6, random_state=0)
model.fit(X)

# Access row and column clustering results
row_membership = model.rows_
col_membership = model.columns_

# Further processing can sort or extract the actual biclusters
# e.g., identify which rows/columns belong to each bicluster
# and examine the corresponding submatrices X[I, J].

Notes
-----
- Biclustering is particularly useful when patterns are localized to subsets of rows and columns.
- Different algorithms optimize different notions of coherence (e.g., constant, additive, checkerboard patterns).
- Memory usage and scalability depend on the chosen algorithm and data size.
