Delete view (preview + confirm + delete)

Overview
The form view delete workflow implemented here provides a safe, user- friendly way to delete an object. It shows a preview of the object and a confirm message before performing the deletion, then redirects to the app index with a success message after the deletion.

DeleteViewMixin
Purpose
Mixin that adds the core preview, confirm, and delete behavior to a Django DeleteView in Django Cradmin.

Key API and behavior
- get_pagetitle: Returns the page title shown in the header. Defaults to "Confirm delete".
- get_action_label: The action label used as the prefix for the page title and as the default for the delete button label. Defaults to "Delete".
- get_delete_button_label: Label for the delete button. Defaults to the value from get_action_label.
- get_cancel_button_label: Label for the cancel button. Defaults to "Cancel".
- get_object_preview: Returns a string representation of the object for the preview area.
- get_confirm_message: Returns the message shown in the confirmation focus area. Defaults to: Are you sure you want to delete "<object_preview>"?
- get_success_url: URL to redirect to after a successful deletion. Defaults to the app index URL for the current app.
- get_success_message(object_preview): Returns the success message to show after deletion. Defaults to 'Deleted "<object_preview>"'.
- add_success_messages(object_preview): Adds the success message to Django’s messages framework if present.
- add_delete_view_mixin_context_data(context): Populates template context with relevant data:
  - model_verbose_name
  - success_url
  - object_preview
  - pagetitle
  - confirm_message
  - delete_button_label
  - cancel_button_label
- delete(request, *args, **kwargs): Performs the actual deletion, then adds success messages based on the object preview.

WithinRoleDeleteView
Purpose
A concrete delete view tailored for views operating within a Cradmin role context.

Inheritance
QuerysetForRoleMixin, DeleteViewMixin, DjangoDeleteView, CommonCradminViewMixin, javascriptregistry.viewmixin.WithinRoleViewMixin

Template
django_cradmin/viewhelpers/formview/within_role_delete_view.django.html

Context data
In get_context_data, the view:
- Adds JavaScript component IDs via add_javascriptregistry_component_ids_to_context
- Adds common Cradmin view mixin data via add_common_view_mixin_data_to_context
- Adds delete view mixin data via add_delete_view_mixin_context_data

What happens during the workflow
- GET request renders a confirmation page showing the object preview and the confirm message, with Delete and Cancel buttons.
- POST request (triggered by pressing Delete) deletes the object, shows a configured success message, and redirects to the success URL (app index).

Template data keys provided for rendering
- object
- model_verbose_name
- success_url
- object_preview
- pagetitle
- confirm_message
- delete_button_label
- cancel_button_label

Notes
- The WithinRoleDeleteView uses the dedicated within_role_delete_view.django.html template to fit the Cradmin role context.
