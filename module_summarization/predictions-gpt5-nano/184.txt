Gaussian Processes
===================

This package provides kernels for Gaussian process regression and classification. The kernels are designed to be easily composable and tunable, enabling flexible modeling of complex functions.

Kernel composition and constants
-------------------------------
- Kernels can be combined through arithmetic operations:
  - Addition: K = K1 + K2
  - Multiplication: K = K1 * K2
  - Exponentiation by a scalar: K = K1 ** a
- Expressions may also contain scalar values. Scalars are automatically converted to a ConstantKernel, enabling seamless kernel engineering without explicit kernel definitions.

Hyperparameters and optimization
-------------------------------
- Each kernel exposes one or more hyperparameters that control its behavior (e.g., length-scales, variances).
- Hyperparameters are described by the Hyperparameter namedtuple with fields:
  - name: the parameter name (e.g., "length_scale" or "constant_value")
  - value_type: the type of the parameter (currently "numeric")
  - bounds: a pair of floats (lower bound, upper bound), or the string "fixed"
  - n_elements: number of elements for vector-valued parameters (default 1)
  - fixed: whether the parameter is fixed (excluded from optimization)
- The hyperparameter space is rectangular: bounds specify a lower and upper value for each parameter.
- If a hyperparameter is marked as "fixed", it is not optimized.
- Vector-valued hyperparameters (n_elements > 1) allow anisotropic settings (e.g., different length-scales per dimension).
- All kernels support analytic gradient-based hyperparameter optimization, enabling efficient tuning within the defined bounds.

Hyperparameter structure and data validation
--------------------------------------------
- The Hyperparameter class provides a compact, memory-efficient specification for each parameter.
- Length-scale handling is validated to be consistent with data dimensionality:
  - Length scales are squeezed to a 1D array.
  - Anisotropic length-scales must match the data dimensionality.
  - Isotropic versus anisotropic configurations are supported.

Internal utilities and references
-------------------------------
- The module includes utilities such as _check_length_scale for validating length-scale inputs.
- It relies on clone for kernel manipulation, and on numerical tools for distance computations and pairwise kernels.
- The design draws inspiration from established kernel implementations to provide a robust, extensible foundation for GP modeling.

API overview
------------
- Hyperparameter: Specification of kernel hyperparameters, including bounds and fixed status (see Hyperparameter namedtuple).
- Kernel: Base class for all kernels, providing a uniform interface and support for kernel composition, hyperparameter exposure, and (where applicable) gradient-based optimization.
- Kernel composition: Use +, *, and ** with scalars to build complex kernels from simple components.
- Parameterization: Hyperparameters may be scalar or vector-valued (n_elements > 1) to support isotropic/anisotropic configurations.

Notes
-----
- The implementation emphasizes analytic gradients for efficient hyperparameter optimization.
- The module is strongly inspired by established kernel ecosystems and is designed to be extended with additional kernel families.
