Gaussian Process Kernels
----------------------

Kernels for Gaussian process regression and classification. This module provides
kernel objects that can be composed to form complex kernels and can be optimized
analytically with respect to their hyperparameters.

Overview
--------

- Kernel-engineering: kernels can be combined using addition (+) and
  multiplication (*) or exponentiated with a scalar (**) to form new kernels.
  Scalar values used in compositions are automatically converted to a constant
  kernel.

- Hyperparameter optimization: all kernels support analytic gradients for
  gradient-based hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameter search space is
  defined by bounds (lower and upper) for each parameter. Hyperparameters can
  also be declared as "fixed" to exclude them from optimization.

- Hyperparameters: hyperparameters are described by the Hyperparameter namedtuple,
  which stores the parameter name, value type, bounds, number of elements, and
  whether it is fixed.

Note
----

This module is strongly inspired by the kernel module of the george package.

Key classes
-----------

Hyperparameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A kernel hyperparameter specification.

Attributes
- name: str
  The parameter name. A kernel using a hyperparameter named "x" should expose
  attributes self.x and self.x_bounds.

- value_type: str
  Type of the hyperparameter (currently numeric).

- bounds: array-like or "fixed"
  Lower and upper bounds for the parameter. For vector-valued hyperparameters
  (n_elements > 1), bounds can be a 2D array with one bound pair per element or
  a single bound pair repeated.

- n_elements: int
  Number of elements in the hyperparameter. 1 corresponds to a scalar hyperparameter.

- fixed: bool
  If True, the hyperparameter is fixed and not optimized. If None, fixed is derived
  from bounds.

Kernel
------

Base class for all kernels.

- get_params(self, deep=True)
  Returns the parameters of this kernel as a dictionary for introspection.
  This supports parameter discovery and copying of kernel instances.

Usage examples
--------------

Basic kernel construction and composition:

.. code-block:: python

    # Example imports (module path may vary)
    # from your_module.gaussian_process import Hyperparameter
    # from your_module.gaussian_process.kernels import ConstantKernel

    # Define a constant kernel
    k_constant = ConstantKernel(constant_value=1.0, constant_value_bounds=(0.0, 10.0))

    # Compose kernels (sum, product, and scalar exponentiation)
    k1 = k_constant + k_constant  # sum of kernels
    k2 = k_constant * 2.0           # scalar times kernel (converted to a constant kernel)
    k3 = (k_constant + 0.5) ** 2.0   # example of exponentiation with scalar

Hyperparameter usage:

.. code-block:: python

    # Define a hyperparameter for a kernel
    hp = Hyperparameter(
        name="constant_value",
        value_type="numeric",
        bounds=[0.0, 10.0],
        n_elements=1,
        fixed=False
    )

Notes
-----
- The search space for hyperparameters is rectangular when using bounds.
- Fixed hyperparameters are excluded from optimization but remain part of
  the kernel configuration.
