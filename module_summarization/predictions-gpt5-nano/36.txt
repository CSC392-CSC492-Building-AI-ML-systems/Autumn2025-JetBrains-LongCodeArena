w_succ
======

List segments which successfully reach a target state

Synopsis
--------
w_succ [OPTIONS]

Description
-----------
This tool lists segments that have reached a target state and are recycled (i.e., successful) in a WestPA simulation. For every iteration, all recycled segments are reported along with their weight and the final value(s) of their progress coordinate(s).

Output format
-------------
- Output is written to standard output by default. Use -o/--output to write to a file.
- A header is printed by default describing the columns (unless headers are suppressed).
  - # successful (recycled) segments
  - # column 0:    iteration
  - # column 1:    seg_id
  - # column 2:    weight
  - # column>2:    final progress coordinate value
- Data lines: one line per recycled segment for each iteration. Each line begins with the iteration number, segment id, and weight, followed by the final progress coordinate values for that segment.
- The final progress coordinates are taken from the last pcoord step (final pcoords) and printed with formatting chosen according to their data type.
- Only segments whose endpoint_type equals SEG_ENDPOINT_RECYCLED are included. If there are no recycled segments in a given iteration, nothing is printed for that iteration.

Notes
------
- The final coordinates can be multi-dimensional.
- The header can be suppressed by the appropriate configuration flag (controlled by CommonOutputMixin).

Options
-------
-o, --output FILE
Store output in FILE (default: write to standard output).

WestPA configuration
--------------------
The tool uses WestPA’s rc system to read configuration and data. It combines:
- CommonOutputMixin (for output formatting options)
- WESTDataReaderMixin (to access segment data and pcoords)
- WESTAnalysisTool (base analysis framework)

Initialization details:
- print_bin_labels is disabled for this tool.

Example
-------
Default (stdout)
# successful (recycled) segments
# column 0:    iteration
# column 1:    seg_id
# column 2:    weight
# column>2:    final progress coordinate value
1    42    0.12345678901234    0.987654321
... (more lines for other recycled segments)

Output to a file
w_succ -o succ.txt
