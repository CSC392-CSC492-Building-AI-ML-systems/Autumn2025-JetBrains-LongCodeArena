Getting Started
===============

Introduction
------------

Mitogen is a Python library designed to manage and communicate with multiple parallel execution contexts—masters, brokers, and child contexts. The core module shown here defines functionality that is common to master and parent processes and is transmitted to child contexts that become parents as connections are established recursively.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python (the project aims to support multiple Python versions, including historical Python 2/3 compatibility)
- A Unix-like operating system (some features rely on POSIX facilities)
- Build and runtime dependencies as specified by the project (refer to the project’s setup instructions)

Installation
------------

- Install via your package manager or with pip:
  - pip install mitogen

Quick Start
-----------

- After installation, import and use Mitogen in your application to create and manage execution contexts (masters, brokers, and children) and to communicate with them efficiently.
- This library is designed to be used both for orchestrating local subprocesses and for coordinating remote execution contexts.

Key Concepts
------------

- Master / Parent: The process that coordinates child contexts and holds the overall control flow.
- Child context: A subprocess or remote context that can become a parent itself for further nested contexts.
- Broker: The component that facilitates communication between contexts.
- PTY and preexec hook: Mechanisms used to manage pseudo-terminals and to customize process startup.
- SELinux handling: The code contains guards to avoid using socketpairs when SELinux is enforced.
- Core functionality: The module shown defines functionality shared by master and parent processes and is transmitted to new child contexts during recursive connections.

Exploring the Codebase
----------------------

- The project organizes internal utilities and core logic into modules that are sent to and executed by child contexts.
- Look for documentation and examples in the repository to understand how master, broker, and child contexts are instantiated and managed.

Running Tests
-------------

- Use your preferred Python testing tool (e.g., pytest, nose) as documented in the repository.
- Ensure environment-specific prerequisites (e.g., OS-level settings for PTY and system limits) are met if you are running tests that exercise PTY or inter-process communication.

Contributing
------------

- Contributions are welcome. Please follow the repository’s contribution guidelines, open issues for discussion, and submit pull requests with tests and documentation.
