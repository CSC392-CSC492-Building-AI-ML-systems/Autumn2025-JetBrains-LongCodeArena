Filenode
=======

Module documentation for the FileNode module used by PyTables to provide a file-like interface to PyTables file nodes.

Overview
--------
The FileNode module provides a file interface for use inside PyTables database files. Use the new_node() function to create a brand new file node which can be read and written as an ordinary Python file. Use open_node() to open an existing node (created with new_node()) for read-only or read-write access. Read access is always available; write access (enabled on new files and files opened with mode 'a+') only allows appending data.

Currently only binary I/O is supported. See filenode_usersguide for instructions on use.

Version history
---------------
Versionchanged:: 3.0
   In version 3.0 the module has been completely rewritten to be fully compliant with the interfaces defined in the io module.

Public API
----------

NodeType
^^^^^^^
Value for NODE_TYPE node system attribute.

NodeTypeVersions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Supported values for NODE_TYPE_VERSION node system attribute.

Classes
-------

RawPyTablesIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Base class for raw binary I/O on HDF5 files using PyTables.

- Inheritance: io.RawIOBase

- Initialization
  - __init__(self, node, mode=None)
    - Sets up the node, mode, position, and internal type information based on the node’s attributes.

- Attributes
  - mode: The file mode in use (read, write, append, etc.)
  - _node: Reference to the underlying PyTables node
  - _pos: Current byte position within the stream
  - _version: NODE_TYPE_VERSION value from the node
  - _vshape: Shape helper derived from the version
  - _vtype: Underlying datatype of the node's data

- Methods
  - tell() -> int
    Return the current stream position.
  - seek(pos, whence=0) -> int
    Change the stream position. whence values: 0 start, 1 current, 2 end.
  - seekable() -> bool
    Return True if the stream supports random access.
  - fileno() -> int
    Return the underlying file descriptor, if available.
  - close() -> None
    Flush and close the IO object; release references to the node.
  - flush() -> None
    Flush write buffers, if applicable.
  - truncate(pos=None) -> int
    Truncate the file to pos bytes (default: current position). Only growing is supported for file nodes.
  - readable() -> bool
    Return True if the stream was opened for reading.
  - writable() -> bool
    Return True if the stream was opened for writing.
  - readinto(b) -> int
    Read up to len(b) bytes into b and return the number of bytes read.
  - readline(limit=-1) -> bytes
    Read and return a line from the stream. If limit is specified, read at most limit bytes.

Notes
-----
- The module is designed to be compliant with Python’s io interfaces.
- Public API focuses on numeric/nestable access through the RawPyTablesIO class and the module-level constants NodeType and NodeTypeVersions.
- See filenode_usersguide for concrete usage guidance.
