Multiclass and Multioutput algorithms
=====================================


Overview
--------

This module implements multioutput regression and classification. The estimators provided are meta-estimators; they require a base estimator to be provided in their constructors. The meta-estimators extend single-output estimators to support multiple targets (multioutput) by training separate models per target or by chaining targets in a sequence.

Key ideas
- Meta-estimators wrap a single-output estimator to handle multiple targets.
- Each target can be modeled independently (one estimator per target) or in a chained fashion (ClassifierChain / RegressorChain).
- Helpers such as _fit_estimator and _partial_fit_estimator support fitting and updating the sub-estimators.
- Internal base class _MultiOutputEstimator provides common structure and constraints for these meta-estimators.

Estimators
----------

MultiOutputRegressor
- Purpose: Extend a regressor to handle multioutput regression by fitting one regressor per target.
- How it works: For each target in y, a clone of the base estimator is trained. Predictions are assembled from the predictions of each sub-estimator.
- Typical usage: When you have multiple continuous targets and want a separate model per target.

MultiOutputClassifier
- Purpose: Extend a classifier to handle multioutput classification by fitting one classifier per target.
- How it works: For each target in y, a clone of the base classifier is trained. Predictions are assembled from the predictions of each sub-estimator.
- Typical usage: When you have multiple binary or multiclass targets and want a separate model per target.

ClassifierChain
- Purpose: Sequence-based multioutput classification.
- How it works: Targets are predicted in a fixed order; each classifier in the chain can use the predictions of previous targets as additional features for training and prediction.
- Typical usage: When target dependencies are suspected and a chained approach may improve performance.

RegressorChain
- Purpose: Sequence-based multioutput regression.
- How it works: Similar to ClassifierChain, but for regression targets; models are trained in a chain and can incorporate prior target predictions as features.

Base and utilities
------------------

_MultiOutputEstimator_ (internal)
- A shared base class for multioutput meta-estimators.
- Enforces parameter constraints (e.g., estimator must provide fit and predict, and n_jobs is an integer or None).

Helper functions
- _fit_estimator(estimator, X, y, sample_weight=None, **fit_params): Clone the base estimator and fit it to the data, returning the fitted sub-estimator.
- _partial_fit_estimator(estimator, X, y, classes=None, partial_fit_params=None, first_time=True): Support for incremental fitting of sub-estimators, cloning on first time as needed.

Parameters
----------

- estimator: The base estimator to wrap. Must implement fit and predict (and, depending on the subclass, may support partial_fit).
- n_jobs: Number of parallel jobs to run for fitting sub-estimators (where supported). None means 1, and -1 means use all available cores.

Notes
- These meta-estimators enable multioutput capabilities without changing the underlying learning algorithm of the base estimator.
- The actual training strategy (independent targets, chaining, parallelization) depends on the specific meta-estimator chosen.

Examples
--------

Basic usage with a regressor:

.. code-block:: python

    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputRegressor

    X, Y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=4, n_targets=3, random_state=0)
    base = LinearRegression()
    mor = MultiOutputRegressor(base)
    mor.fit(X, Y)
    Y_pred = mor.predict(X)

Basic usage with a classifier:

.. code-block:: python

    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputClassifier

    X, Y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=20, n_classes=2, n_outputs=3, random_state=0)
    base = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
    moc = MultiOutputClassifier(base)
    moc.fit(X, Y)
    Y_pred = moc.predict(X)
