Contributing to Qiskit Metal
==============================

Thank you for your interest in improving Qiskit Metal. This guide describes how to contribute, set up your development environment, and the standards we follow to keep the project healthy and easy to use.

Getting started
--------------

- Browse open issues to find small fixes or feature ideas that match your interests.
- Open a new issue to discuss a larger feature or a bug you plan to tackle before you start.
- If you’re ready to contribute code, fork the repository, create a feature branch, implement your changes, add tests, and open a pull request.

What you’ll work on
-------------------

Qiskit Metal contains components for electromagnetic design and analysis. The codebase includes modules such as:

- qiskit_metal.analyses
  - cpw_calculations: calculations related to coplanar waveguides, including parameters like guided_wavelength.
  - lumped_capacitive: lumped-element representations for CPW geometries.

When contributing, consider adding or updating:
- Functions that implement physical calculations (with clear, well-documented docstrings).
- Unit tests that validate new behavior or edge cases.
- Documentation strings and references in Sphinx-compatible formats.

Development setup
-----------------

Recommended environment
- Python 3.x (see repository requirements for exact versions).
- A virtual environment (venv, conda, or your preferred tool).

Getting the code
- git clone <repository-url>
- cd qiskit-metal
- Create and activate your virtual environment
- Install development requirements (example: pip install -e .[dev,docs])

Testing locally
- Run the full test suite: pytest -q
- Run a subset of tests (e.g., analyses): pytest -q tests/analyses
- Ensure new features are covered by unit tests and existing tests pass

Documentation and docstrings
- All public APIs should have clear docstrings in reStructuredText format to support Sphinx documentation.
- Add autosummary entries where appropriate (as seen in modules under qiskit_metal.analyses).
- Update or add documentation pages if you introduce new modules, classes, or functions.

Coding style and quality
- Follow Python’s PEP 8 style guidelines.
- Use expressive names, type hints where helpful, and keep functions small and focused.
- Include tests for new functionality or bug fixes.
- Preserve license and copyright notices in modified files (Apache License 2.0).

Submitting changes
- Create a descriptive feature/bugfix branch name.
- Write clear commit messages that explain the rationale and changes.
- Include tests and documentation updates with your PR.
- Run the test suite and lint checks before submitting.
- Submit the pull request and respond to reviewer feedback promptly.

Design and API guidelines
- Changes to core analyses (e.g., qiskit_metal.analyses.cpw_calculations or lumped_capacitive) should come with:
  - Clear function-level docstrings.
  - Examples in the documentation showing typical usage.
  - Unit tests that cover typical cases and edge cases.
- When adding new modules, provide autosummary entries in the module’s documentation to help users discover the API.

Licensing and attribution
- All contributions must retain the project’s Apache License 2.0 notice.
- If you modify files, carry a notice indicating that they have been altered from the originals.

Support and community
- If you need help, reach out through the project’s official channels or the contributor community.
- Be respectful and collaborative in code reviews and discussions.

By contributing, you help make Qiskit Metal more robust, usable, and up-to-date for researchers and developers working on quantum hardware design.
