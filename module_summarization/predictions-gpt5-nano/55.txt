T-Distribution Likelihood Models for Linear and ARMA Processes
=============================================================

Overview
--------
This module implements maximum likelihood estimation for models with
Student-t distributed errors. The heavier tails of the t-distribution provide
robustness to outliers and departures from normality.

Models
------
- TLinearModel: A linear regression model with t-distributed errors, implemented as a GenericLikelihoodModel. It estimates regression coefficients (beta), degrees of freedom (df), and a scale parameter. The degrees of freedom can be fixed or estimated. Start values are derived from OLS and can optionally use kurtosis to set df. The log-likelihood is based on the standard Student-t distribution, and predictions are the usual linear predictions.

- TArma: A univariate ARMA model with t-distributed errors, derived from Arma. It overrides the log-likelihood related methods to handle the t-distribution. The implied error variance is scale^2 * df/(df-2). The model uses the last element of the parameter vector as the scale (positive via abs). Prediction relies on the underlying ARMA machinery.

Key API
-------
TLinearModel
- Inherits from GenericLikelihoodModel
- Parameters: beta (regression coefficients), df (degrees of freedom), scale
- df can be fixed via fix_df; when fix_df is False, both df and scale are estimated; otherwise only scale is estimated
- Methods:
  - initialize: set up parameter structure and start values
  - _set_start_params: derive starting values from OLS; optionally use kurtosis to set df
  - loglike / nloglikeobs: negative log-likelihood computations for the t-distributed errors
  - predict: return linear predictions given parameters

TArma
- Inherits from Arma
- Overrides loglike and nloglikeobs to use t-distributed errors
- Parameters: ARMA coefficients, df, scale
- log-likelihood is computed per observation using the t-distribution of residuals
- Prediction leverages the base ARMA machinery

Notes
-----
- The scale parameter is taken as abs(value) to ensure positivity
- The standard deviation is not equal to the scale parameter for the t-distribution
- This module serves as a demonstrator for generic MLE with t-distributed errors
- Original code provides an example header, references, and development notes
