Table Data
==========

Overview
--------
Table Data refers to structured data organized in rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column holds values of a specific type. The implementation in this context provides utilities for validating table data, reporting errors in a hierarchical manner, and notifying interested parties about changes to the table data.

Data Model
----------
- Tables are conceptual collections of records organized into columns and rows.
- Validation results can be represented as nested error lists, allowing multi-level reporting that mirrors the structure of complex data checks.
- Change notification is supported through a mixin that enables objects to register listeners and publish updates when the table data changes.

Validation and Verification
---------------------------
The code defines the core components for validating table data and handling verification results.

- VerifyError and VerifyWarning
  - Custom exception for verification failures.
  - Warning subclass used to communicate non-fatal verification issues.

- VERIFY_OPTIONS
  - A list of supported verification modes:
    - ignore, warn, exception
    - fix, silentfix
    - fix+ignore, fix+warn, fix+exception
    - silentfix+ignore, silentfix+warn, silentfix+exception

- _Verify class
  - Shared utilities for performing verification on table data.
  - run_option(option="warn", err_text="", fix_text="Fixed.", fix=None, fixable=True)
    - Executes verification with the selected option.
    - Returns a tuple (fixable, text) describing whether issues were fixable and a message.
    - Behavior depends on the option:
      - "warn"/"exception": non-fixable; may suppress fixes.
      - Others: may apply a fix function if provided and append a fix note.
  - verify(option="warn")
    - Validates all values in the instance.
    - Accepts options as described in VERIFY_OPTIONS, including combinations with "+" (e.g., "fix+warn").
    - Splits fix and reporting behavior when applicable.
    - Reports results via warnings or raises VerifyError based on the chosen options.
    - Prepares messages with a header and a note about indexing.

- _ErrList
  - A nested list structure for verification error messages.
  - __str__ provides a readable concatenation of messages.
  - iter_lines(filter=None, shift=0)
    - Traverses the nested structure, yielding (header, indented_message) pairs.
    - Supports filters and indentation to represent hierarchical messages.

Error Reporting
---------------
- Verification results are collected in a nested structure and can be formatted for human-readable output.
- Messages are optionally printed as warnings (VerifyWarning) or raised as exceptions (VerifyError), depending on the verification options.
- The output includes a standard header and a note about indexing conventions.

Change Notification
-------------------
- NotifierMixin
  - Mixin class that enables objects to register listeners and notify them of changes.
  - Listeners are registered via a private (underscored) API to encourage internal usage and weak-referencing.
  - _add_listener(listener)
    - Registers a listener with a weak reference so unused listeners are automatically dropped.
  - _notify(change_type, *args, **kwargs)
    - Notifies all listeners by calling their corresponding update method, if present.
  - Listeners are optional; if a listener does not provide the expected update method, it is ignored.
  - This mechanism supports decoupled reaction to table data changes (e.g., UI updates, caches).

Usage and Examples
------------------
- Validation:
  - Use the verification framework to check table data integrity, report issues, and optionally fix fixable problems according to the desired mode (warn, ignore, exception, etc.).
- Notifications:
  - Attach listeners to a table-like object to react to changes, keeping dependent components synchronized with the table data state.

Notes
-----
- The documentation above reflects the behavior and structure implied by the implemented classes and options:
  - VerifyError, VerifyWarning, and VERIFY_OPTIONS
  - _Verify.run_option and _Verify.verify
  - _ErrList for nested error reporting
  - NotifierMixin for change notification across table data components
