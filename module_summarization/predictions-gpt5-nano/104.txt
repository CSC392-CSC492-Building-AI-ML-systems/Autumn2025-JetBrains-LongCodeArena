Diophantine
===========

Overview
--------

This module provides a solver for Diophantine equations. The main entry point is diophantine(eq, param=…, syms=None), which reformulates the given equation into a product of terms that must be zero and then solves each term separately. The solutions are combined to yield a set of tuples, where each tuple contains one solution for every variable in alphabetical order.

Public API
----------

diophantine(eq, param=symbols('t', integer=True), syms=None)

- Description
  Simplifies the solution procedure of a Diophantine equation by converting it into a product of zero terms. Each term is solved via diop_solve, and the resulting solutions are merged. The output is a set of tuples, with the i-th element of a tuple corresponding to the solution for the i-th variable (ordered alphabetically). If syms is provided, only the listed symbols are kept in the returned tuples, in their specified order.

- Parameters
  - eq: Relational or Expr
    The equation to be solved.
  - param: Symbol, optional
    The parameter to be used in the solution (default: t).
  - syms: list of Symbol, optional
    An explicit sequence of symbols to determine the ordering of the tuple elements.

- Returns
  A set of tuples representing parametric solutions. Each tuple contains one solution per variable as ordered by syms (or alphabetically if syms is not provided).

- Examples
  - diophantine(x**2 - y**2)
    {(t_0, -t_0), (t_0, t_0)}

  - diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))
    {(0, n1, n2), (t_0, t_1, 2*t_0 + 3*t_1)}

  - diophantine(x**2 + 3*x*y + 4*x)
    {(0, n1), (3*t_0 - 4, -t_0)}

See Also
--------

- diofant.solvers.diophantine.diop_solve
  Internal solver used to handle individual Diophantine components.

- classify_diop
  Internal classifier used to determine the type of the Diophantine term (e.g., linear, quadratic, etc.).

Internal helpers
----------------

The module also defines several private utility helpers used by diophantine and related routines.

- _is_int(i)
  Return True if i can be interpreted as an integer via as_int; otherwise False.

- _sorted_tuple(*i)
  Return a sorted tuple of the provided values.

- _remove_gcd(*x)
  Divide all inputs by their greatest common divisor and return the reduced tuple. If gcd cannot be determined, returns the inputs unchanged.

- _rational_pq(a, b)
  Return the reduced rational a/b as a (numerator, denominator) pair with gcd removed and sign placed in the numerator.

- _nint_or_floor(p, q)
  Return the integer closest to p/q; in case of a tie, return floor(p/q).

- _odd(i)
  Return True if i is odd.

- _even(i)
  Return True if i is even.

Known Diophantine types
-----------------------

The module maintains a set of known Diophantine problem types that may appear during solving, e.g.:

- 'binary_quadratic'
- 'cubic_thue'
- 'general_pythagorean'
- 'general_sum_of_even_powers'
- 'general_sum_of_squares'
- 'homogeneous_general_quadratic'
- 'homogeneous_ternary_quadratic'
- 'homogeneous_ternary_quadratic_normal'
- 'inhomogeneous_general_quadratic'
- 'inhomogeneous_ternary_quadratic'
- 'linear'
- 'univariate'

Notes
-----

- If the equation cannot be represented as a polynomial with rational coefficients, a TypeError is raised.
- The solver ultimately returns a set of parameterized solutions, including the trivial solution if applicable.
- The actual internal behavior relies on classify_diop and diop_solve, which perform the classification and term-wise solving respectively.
