Generate documentation for this code
===================================

Overview
--------
This page documents a module that auto-generates a Sphinx-friendly mathematical
documentation string at import time. It builds a collection of hypergeometric
formulae and renders each as a LaTeX equation suitable for inclusion in
documentation.

What it documents
------------------
- A FormulaCollection of hypergeometric expansions
- The process of converting each formula into a LaTeX representation
  via a mathematical equality (Eq) between a hypergeometric expression and its
  closed-form rewrite
- The resulting documentation string stored in the module’s __doc__ attribute
  and exposed to Sphinx as part of the generated docs

How the documentation is generated
-------------------------------
- The module creates a FormulaCollection instance (c = FormulaCollection()).
- It iterates over c.formulae and, for each formula f, constructs:
  Eq(hyper(f.func.ap, f.func.bq, f.z), f.closed_form.rewrite('nonrepsmall'))
- Each such equation is converted to LaTeX using latex(obj) and added to a
  documentation string as a math directive:
  .. math::
    <LaTeX representation>
- The accumulated string is assigned to __doc__, making the entire set of
  expansions visible in Sphinx documentation.

Algorithmic and modeling notes
------------------------------
- The module documents the expansion of Hypergeometric and Meijer G functions
  into named special functions using a lookup-table approach.
- It references foundational work (e.g., Roach, 1997) and notes that
  detailed descriptions are also present in the Sphinx docs.
- Key concepts described in the embedded docstring include:
  - Shift operators and their impact on parameters
  - Order reduction when certain parameter differences are non-negative integers
  - The notion of suitable index quadruples and reachability
  - Practical use of hand-built matching routines to instantiate formulas

Extending the knowledge base
----------------------------
- The add_formulae(formulae) function provides the mechanism to populate the
  knowledge base with new formulae.
- It defines helpers to register single and multi-parameter expansions and uses
  symbolic placeholders (a, b, c, z) for indexing the formulas.
- The function relies on:
  - Core objects (Eq, Hyper_Function, Dummy, etc.)
  - Hypergeometric representations (HyperRep_* and hyper)
  - Matrix-based representations for higher-order cases (e.g., 2F1)

Usage notes
-----------
- The generated __doc__ content is intended to be consumed by Sphinx, so
  each entry is formatted as a math directive (.. math::) containing the LaTeX
  representation of the corresponding identity.
- This approach keeps documentation self-updating as the formula collection
  evolves.

Example
-------
- On importing the module, Sphinx sees the module docstring consisting of a
  sequence of math blocks, each representing a hypergeometric identity expanded
  into a named special function.
