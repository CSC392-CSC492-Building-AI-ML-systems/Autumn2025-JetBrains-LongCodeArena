The :mod:`sklearn.naive_bayes` module implements Naive Bayes algorithms. These are supervised learning methods based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) feature independence assumptions.

Overview
========
Naive Bayes classifiers are simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. This module provides several implementations that differ in how they model the class-conditional feature distributions.

Classes
=======
BernoulliNB
----------
Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier for multivariate Bernoulli distributed data.

GaussianNB
----------
Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier for continuous data.

- Can perform online updates to model parameters via partial_fit.
- See the Stanford CS tech report STAN-CS-79-773 for the online update approach:
  http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/79/773/CS-TR-79-773.pdf
- See also the User Guide on Gaussian Naive Bayes.

MultinomialNB
-----------
Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for discrete data (e.g., word counts for text classification).

ComplementNB
------------
Complement Naive Bayes classifier designed for imbalanced data.

CategoricalNB
-------------
Categorical Naive Bayes classifier for categorical features.

Base classes
============
_BaseNB
-------
Abstract base class for naive Bayes estimators.

- Provides common API for predicting joint log probabilities, predicting labels, and probability estimates.
- Subclasses implement _joint_log_likelihood and _check_X.

GaussianNB specifics
====================
Parameters
----------
priors : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
    Prior probabilities of the classes. If specified, the priors are not
    adjusted according to the data.

var_smoothing : float, default=1e-9
    Portion of the largest variance of all features that is added to
    variances for calculation stability.

Attributes
----------
class_count_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
    Number of training samples observed in each class.

class_prior_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
    Probability of each class.

classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
    Class labels known to the classifier.

epsilon_ : float
    Absolute additive value to variances.

n_features_in_ : int
    Number of features seen during fit.

feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (n_features_in_,)
    Names of features seen during fit (if provided as strings).

var_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_features)
    Variance of each feature per class.

theta_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_features)
    Mean of each feature per class.

Notes
-----
Internal implementation follows the standard Gaussian Naive Bayes approach with online update capability via partial_fit.
