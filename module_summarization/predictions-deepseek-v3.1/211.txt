Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models
=======================================

Bayesian inference for generalized linear mixed models.

Currently only families without additional scale or shape parameters
are supported (binomial and Poisson).

Two estimation approaches are supported: Laplace approximation
('maximum a posteriori'), and variational Bayes (mean field
approximation to the posterior distribution).

All realizations of random effects are modeled to be mutually
independent in this implementation.

Model Parameterization
----------------------

The joint density of data and parameters factors as:

.. math::

    p(y | vc, fep) p(vc | vcp) p(vcp) p(fe)

The terms :math:`p(vcp)` and :math:`p(fe)` are prior distributions
that are taken to be Gaussian (the :math:`vcp` parameters are log
standard deviations so the standard deviations have log-normal
distributions).  The random effects distribution :math:`p(vc | vcp)`
is independent Gaussian (random effect realizations are independent
within and between values of the `ident` array).  The model
:math:`p(y | vc, fep)` depends on the specific GLM being fit.

Random Effects Structure
------------------------

The `exog_vc` matrix is the design matrix for the random effects.
Every column of `exog_vc` corresponds to an independent realization of
a random effect.  These random effects have mean zero and an unknown
standard deviation.  The standard deviation parameters are constrained
to be equal within subsets of the columns. When not using formulas,
these subsets are specified through the parameter `ident`.  `ident`
must have the same length as the number of columns of `exog_vc`, and
two columns whose `ident` values are equal have the same standard
deviation.  When formulas are used, the columns of `exog_vc` derived
from a common formula are constrained to have the same standard
deviation.

In many applications, `exog_vc` will be sparse.  A sparse matrix may
be passed when constructing a model class.  If a dense matrix is
passed, it will be converted internally to a sparse matrix.  There
currently is no way to avoid creating a temporary dense version of
`exog_vc` when using formulas.

API Reference
-------------

.. autoclass:: MixedGLM
   :members:
   :inherited-members:

The MixedGLM class implements the Laplace approximation to the posterior
distribution (`fit_map`) and a variational Bayes approximation to
the posterior (`fit_vb`).

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~
endog : array_like
    Vector of response values.
exog : array_like
    Array of covariates for the fixed effects part of the mean
    structure.
exog_vc : array_like
    Array of covariates for the random part of the model.  A
    scipy.sparse array may be provided, or else the passed
    array will be converted to sparse internally.
ident : array_like
    Array of integer labels showing which random terms (columns
    of `exog_vc`) have a common variance.
vcp_p : float
    Prior standard deviation for variance component parameters
    (the prior standard deviation of log(s) is vcp_p, where s is
    the standard deviation of a random effect).
fe_p : float
    Prior standard deviation for fixed effects parameters.
family : statsmodels.genmod.families instance
    The GLM family.
fep_names : list of strings
    The names of the fixed effects parameters (corresponding to
    columns of exog).  If None, default names are constructed.
vcp_names : list of strings
    The names of the variance component parameters (corresponding
    to distinct labels in ident).  If None, default names are
    constructed.
vc_names : list of strings
    The names of the random effect realizations.

Returns

MixedGLMResults object

Notes
~~~~~
There are three types of values in the posterior distribution:
fixed effects parameters (fep), corresponding to the columns of
`exog`, random effects realizations (vc), corresponding to the
columns of `exog_vc`, and the standard deviations of the random
effects realizations (vcp), corresponding to the unique integer
labels in `ident`.

All random effects are modeled as being independent Gaussian
values (given the variance structure parameters).  Every column of
`exog_vc` has a distinct realized random effect that is used to
form the linear predictors.  The elements of `ident` determine the
distinct variance structure parameters.  Two random effect
realizations that have the same value in `ident` have the same
variance.  When fitting with a formula, `ident` is constructed
internally (each element of `vc_formulas` yields a distinct label
in `ident`).

The random effect standard deviation parameters (`vcp`) have
log-normal prior distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation
`vcp_p`.

Note that for some families, e.g. Binomial, the posterior mode may
be difficult to find numerically if `vcp_p` is set to too large of
a value.  Setting `vcp_p` to 0.5 seems to work well.

The prior for the fixed effects parameters is Gaussian with mean 0
and standard deviation `fe_p`.
