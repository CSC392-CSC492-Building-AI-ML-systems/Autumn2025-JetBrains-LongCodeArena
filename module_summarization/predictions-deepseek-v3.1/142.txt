Delayed Objects
---------------

.. autoclass:: Delayed
   :members:
   :special-members: __getitem__, __iter__, __len__
   :inherited-members:

   A Delayed object represents a computation that hasn't been executed yet.
   It wraps a computation graph and can be combined with other Delayed objects
   to build more complex computations.

delayed Function
----------------

.. autofunction:: delayed

   Decorator or function to create delayed computations. Can be used as:
   
   - A decorator: ``@delayed``
   - A function: ``delayed(func)(*args, **kwargs)``
   - With pure computations: ``delayed(obj, pure=True)``

Utility Functions
-----------------

.. autofunction:: unpack_collections

   Normalizes Python objects and merges all sub-graphs. Handles:
   
   - Replacing Delayed objects with their keys
   - Converting literals to scheduler-compatible formats
   - Extracting dask graphs from enclosed values
   
   Returns a tuple of (normalized_task, collections).

.. autofunction:: finalize

   Creates a finalization task for a dask collection. Returns a Delayed object
   that represents the finalized computation.

.. autofunction:: to_task_dask

   .. deprecated:: 
      This function has been deprecated in favor of unpack_collections.

   Normalizes Python objects and merges sub-graphs (legacy implementation).

.. autofunction:: unzip

   Unzips a list of lists into specified number of outputs.

Internal Functions
------------------

The module also contains several internal utility functions and imports for
handling:

- Dask collection interface methods
- Graph construction and manipulation
- Type checking and normalization
- Operator method mixing for delayed operations

The delayed interface provides a way to build complex computational graphs
lazily, which are then executed efficiently by dask schedulers.
