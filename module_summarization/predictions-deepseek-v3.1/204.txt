Random Projection
=================

Random Projection is a simple and computationally efficient method for
dimensionality reduction that trades a controlled amount of accuracy
(as additional variance) for faster processing times and smaller model sizes.

The technique preserves pairwise distances between samples in the dataset
through carefully controlled dimensions and distribution of random projection
matrices.

Theoretical Background
----------------------

The efficiency of random projection is supported by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
lemma, which states that a small set of points in a high-dimensional space can
be embedded into a space of much lower dimension while nearly preserving the
distances between points. The embedding can be achieved using an orthogonal
projection.

Key Function: johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim
-------------------------------------------

The ``johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim`` function calculates a safe minimum number
of components to project to while maintaining the distortion constraints
specified by the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma.

The distortion introduced by a random projection ``p`` ensures that distances
between points change by at most a factor of (1 ± eps) with good probability.
The formula for the minimum number of components is:

    n_components >= 4 log(n_samples) / (eps² / 2 - eps³ / 3)

Parameters:
- ``n_samples``: Number of samples (int or array-like)
- ``eps``: Maximum distortion rate (float or array-like in range (0,1))

Returns the minimal number of components needed to guarantee the eps-embedding.

Implementation Details
----------------------

The package provides:
- Gaussian random matrix generation with components drawn from N(0, 1.0/n_components)
- Input validation for density parameters and matrix dimensions
- Support for both dense and sparse random projections

The method is particularly useful for large datasets where conventional
dimensionality reduction techniques would be computationally expensive.

Examples
--------

>>> from sklearn.random_projection import johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim
>>> johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim(1e6, eps=0.5)
663

>>> johnson_lindenstrauss_min_dim([1e4, 1e5, 1e6], eps=0.1)
array([ 7894,  9868, 11841])
