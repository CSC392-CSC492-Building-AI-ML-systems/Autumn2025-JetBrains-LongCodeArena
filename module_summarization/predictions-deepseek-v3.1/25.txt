w_ipa - WESTPA Interactive Python Analysis Tool
================================================

Overview
--------
The ``w_ipa`` command provides an interactive Python analysis environment for WESTPA (Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis) data analysis. This stateful tool allows users to examine trajectories, weights, progress coordinates, and other simulation data interactively.

Features
--------
- Interactive exploration of WESTPA simulation data
- Stateful environment maintaining current analysis context
- Access to walkers, weights, progress coordinates, and auxiliary data
- Trace functionality to follow segment histories
- Multiple analysis scheme support
- Both graphical (matplotlib) and terminal-based interfaces

Basic Usage
-----------
The tool is typically invoked without arguments for interactive use:

.. code-block:: bash

    w_ipa

For analysis-only mode (non-interactive):

.. code-block:: bash

    w_ipa --analysis-only

Command-line Options
--------------------
``--analysis-only, -ao``
    Run analysis and return to terminal without interactive session

``--reanalyze, -ra``
    Delete existing analysis files and reanalyze from scratch

``--ignore-hash, -ih``
    Ignore hash checking and don't regenerate analysis files

``--debug, -d``
    Enable debug output for development purposes

``--terminal, -t``
    Use terminal-based plotting instead of graphical interface

Interactive Environment
----------------------
Once in the interactive environment, several objects and properties are available:

**Core Properties:**
- ``w.iteration`` or ``west.iteration`` - Get/set current iteration
- ``w.list_schemes`` - List available analysis schemes
- ``w.scheme`` - Get/set current analysis scheme
- ``w.states`` - View defined states in current scheme
- ``w.bin_labels`` - View bin labels in current scheme

**Current Iteration Data:**
The ``w.current`` object provides access to:
- Walkers data
- Summary statistics
- Segment IDs
- Weights
- Parent information
- Kinetic averages
- Progress coordinates
- Bin assignments
- Population data
- Auxiliary data (if available)

**Key Function:**
- ``w.trace(seg_id)`` - Trace a segment's history through iterations

Example Session
---------------
.. code-block:: python

    # Set iteration to examine
    w.iteration = 100
    
    # List available analysis schemes
    schemes = w.list_schemes
    
    # Select a scheme
    w.scheme = schemes[0]
    
    # Examine current iteration data
    current_data = w.current
    print(f"Current weights: {current_data.weights}")
    
    # Trace a specific segment
    trace_data = w.trace(seg_id=42)

Notes
-----
- The tool automatically uses the first enabled analysis scheme from west.cfg
- Default starting iteration is 1
- Trace operations can be computationally expensive for long histories
- Both ``w`` and ``west`` objects provide identical functionality
- Help is available for all functions and properties using Python's help() system

Version
-------
Current version: 1.0B
