Using lists
============

The ftrack API provides a powerful and flexible way to work with collections of entities through its list implementation. Lists in ftrack API are not standard Python lists but specialized collection objects that provide additional functionality for working with ftrack data.

Basic Usage
-----------

Lists are typically returned when querying for multiple entities or accessing relationship collections:

.. code-block:: python

    # Query returns a list of entities
    projects = session.query('Project').all()
    
    # Relationship access returns a list
    project = session.query('Project').first()
    tasks = project['tasks']

List Operations
---------------

ftrack lists support many standard Python list operations:

.. code-block:: python

    # Length checking
    len(tasks)
    
    # Index access
    first_task = tasks[0]
    
    # Slicing
    first_three_tasks = tasks[:3]
    
    # Iteration
    for task in tasks:
        print(task['name'])
    
    # Membership testing
    if specific_task in tasks:
        print('Task found')

Special Features
----------------

ftrack lists provide additional functionality beyond standard Python lists:

* **Lazy loading**: Lists can automatically fetch additional data from the server as needed
* **Filtering**: Use the `filter()` method to create filtered views of the list
* **Sorting**: Use the `sort()` method to sort the list by specific attributes
* **Pagination**: Large lists are automatically handled with pagination

Example with filtering:

.. code-block:: python

    # Filter tasks by status
    completed_tasks = tasks.filter('status.name is "Completed"')
    
    # Chain multiple filters
    important_tasks = tasks.filter('priority.name is "High"').filter('status.name is "Not Started"')

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

When working with large lists, consider:

* Use filtering on the server side when possible to reduce data transfer
* Be mindful of auto-population settings which can trigger additional queries
* Large lists are paginated automatically - iterate through results rather than converting to a regular list

The list implementation is designed to be intuitive for Python developers while providing the powerful data management capabilities needed for working with ftrack entities.
