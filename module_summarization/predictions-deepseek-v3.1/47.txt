Contingency Tables
==================

The ``contingency_tables`` module provides methods for analyzing two-way contingency tables (i.e. frequency tables for observations that are cross-classified with respect to two categorical variables).

Overview
--------

This module contains classes and functions for statistical analysis of contingency tables, with support for different table types and specialized statistical tests.

Main Classes
------------

Table
~~~~~
A two-way contingency table class that implements methods applicable to any two-way contingency table.

**Parameters:**
- ``table`` : array_like - A contingency table
- ``shift_zeros`` : boolean - If True and any cell count is zero, add 0.5 to all values in the table

**Attributes:**
- ``table_orig`` : array_like - The original table is cached as table_orig

**Methods:**
- ``from_data(cls, data, shift_zeros=True)`` - Construct a Table object from raw data
- ``test_nominal_association()`` - Assess independence for nominal factors using chi² testing
- ``test_ordinal_association(row_scores=None, col_scores=None)`` - Assess independence between two ordinal variables using linear by linear association test

SquareTable
~~~~~~~~~~~
Implements methods that can be applied to a square two-way contingency table.

Table2x2
~~~~~~~~
Implements methods that can be applied to a 2x2 contingency table.

StratifiedTable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implements methods that can be applied to a collection of 2x2 contingency tables.

Additional Functions
--------------------

The module also contains functions for conducting:
- McNemar's test
- Cochran's q test

Utility Functions
-----------------

``_make_df_square(table)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reindex a pandas DataFrame so that it becomes square, meaning that the row and column indices contain the same values, in the same order.

``_Bunch``
~~~~~~~~~~
A utility class for storing and displaying results with a formatted string representation.

Notes
-----

The inference procedures may depend on how the data were sampled. In general, the observed units are assumed to be independent and identically distributed.
