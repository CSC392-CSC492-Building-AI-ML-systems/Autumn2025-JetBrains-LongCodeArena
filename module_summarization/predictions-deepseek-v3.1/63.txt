Commands
========

This module provides command-line functions for managing database migrations with Alembic.

.. currentmodule:: alembic.command

.. autofunction:: list_templates

.. autofunction:: init

.. autofunction:: revision

The commands support various options for generating migration scripts, initializing environments, and managing revision history. Each command accepts a :class:`~alembic.config.Config` object as its primary parameter and provides different functionality for migration management.

Note: The ``revision`` command supports both manual revision creation and automatic generation based on database schema differences when used with the ``--autogenerate`` option.
