Kernel Approximation
====================

The :mod:`sklearn.kernel_approximation` module implements several
approximate kernel feature maps based on Fourier transforms and Count Sketches.

   See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_kernel_approximation_plot_polynomial_count_sketch.py`
   for an example of using PolynomialCountSketch for kernel approximation.

Notes
-----
The PolynomialCountSketch class implements Tensor Sketch, which approximates the
feature map of the polynomial kernel:

    K(X, Y) = (gamma * <X, Y> + coef0)^degree

by efficiently computing a Count Sketch of the outer product of a vector with
itself using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).

This approach provides a computationally efficient way to approximate polynomial
kernel features without explicitly computing the high-dimensional feature space,
making it suitable for large-scale machine learning problems.
