w_select
========

Select dynamics segments matching various criteria. This requires a user-provided predicate function. By default, only matching segments are stored. If the -a/--include-ancestors option is given, then matching segments and their ancestors will be stored.

Predicate Function
------------------

Segments are selected based on a predicate function, which must be callable as ``predicate(n_iter, iter_group)`` and return a collection of segment IDs matching the predicate in that iteration.

The predicate may be inverted by specifying the -v/--invert command-line argument.

Output Format
-------------

The output file (-o/--output, by default "select.h5") contains the following datasets:

``/n_iter`` [iteration]
  *(Integer)* Iteration numbers for each entry in other datasets.

``/n_segs`` [iteration]
  *(Integer)* Number of segment IDs matching the predicate (or inverted predicate, if -v/--invert is specified) in the given iteration.

``/seg_ids`` [iteration][segment]
  *(Integer)* Matching segments in each iteration. For an iteration ``n_iter``, only the first ``n_iter`` entries are valid. For example, the full list of matching seg_ids in the first stored iteration is ``seg_ids[0][:n_segs[0]]``.

``/weights`` [iteration][segment]
  *(Floating-point)* Weights for each matching segment in ``/seg_ids``.

Command-line Options
--------------------

**Selection options:**

``-p MODULE.FUNCTION, --predicate-function MODULE.FUNCTION``
  Use the given predicate function to match segments. This function should take an iteration number and the HDF5 group corresponding to that iteration and return a sequence of seg_ids matching the predicate, as in ``match_predicate(n_iter, iter_group)``.

``-v, --invert``
  Invert the match predicate.

``-a, --include-ancestors``
  Include ancestors of matched segments in output.

**Output options:**

``-o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT``
  Write output to OUTPUT (default: select.h5).
