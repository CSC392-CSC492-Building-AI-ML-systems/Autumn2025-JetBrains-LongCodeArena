Computational Performance
==========================

This document outlines the computational performance considerations and dependencies for the scikit-learn library.

Minimum Dependencies
====================

The library maintains specific minimum version requirements for optimal performance and compatibility:

Core Dependencies
-----------------
- **NumPy**: >= 1.17.3 (1.19.2 for PyPy implementation)
- **SciPy**: >= 1.5.0
- **joblib**: >= 1.1.1
- **threadpoolctl**: >= 2.0.0

These core numerical and parallel processing libraries are essential for the computational efficiency of scikit-learn's algorithms.

Build and Development Dependencies
----------------------------------
- **Cython**: >= 0.29.33 (for building C extensions)
- **pytest**: >= 7.1.2 (for testing)
- **ruff**: >= 0.0.272 (for code quality)
- **black**: >= 23.3.0 (for code formatting)

Parallel Processing Support
===========================

The library utilizes joblib and threadpoolctl for efficient parallel computation:

- **n_jobs parameter**: Many estimators support parallelization through the `n_jobs` parameter
- **Thread pool control**: threadpoolctl provides fine-grained control over thread pooling
- **Memory mapping**: joblib enables efficient memory management for large datasets

Performance Optimization Features
=================================

Multi-output Estimators
-----------------------
The multi-output regression and classification implementation:

- Supports meta-estimators that extend single-output estimators to multioutput problems
- Utilizes parallel fitting of estimators through joblib Parallel and delayed execution
- Implements efficient partial_fit capabilities for incremental learning
- Provides chain classifiers and regressors for structured output predictions

The implementation includes performance optimizations such as:
- Estimator cloning for independent model fitting
- Efficient sample weight handling
- Metadata routing for advanced configuration
- Cross-validation predictions with parallel execution

Memory Efficiency
-----------------
- Sparse matrix support through scipy.sparse integration
- Memory profiling capabilities via memory_profiler dependency
- Efficient array operations using NumPy optimizations

Hardware Considerations
=======================

The library is optimized for:
- Multi-core processors (through joblib parallelization)
- Efficient memory usage patterns
- Compatibility with various Python implementations (CPython, PyPy)

Note: Performance may vary based on the specific hardware configuration and the chosen dependency versions.
