Getting Started with Mitogen
============================

Introduction
------------
Mitogen is a Python library for writing distributed self-replicating programs. It enables efficient and transparent remote execution of Python code, making it ideal for automation, orchestration, and distributed computing tasks. This guide will help you quickly start using Mitogen in your projects.

Installation
------------
You can install Mitogen using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install mitogen

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install from source:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/dw/mitogen.git
   cd mitogen
   python setup.py install

Basic Usage
-----------
To use Mitogen, you typically create a `Context` which represents a connection to a remote or local context. Here's a simple example:

.. code-block:: python

   import mitogen

   # Create a context for the local machine
   with mitogen.local.Context() as context:
       # Execute a command remotely
       result = context.call(os.getpid)
       print("Remote PID:", result)

Advanced Contexts
-----------------
Mitogen supports various context types including SSH, Docker, and more. For example, to connect via SSH:

.. code-block:: python

   with mitogen.ssh.Context(hostname='example.com') as context:
       result = context.call(lambda: os.uname())
       print("Remote uname:", result)

Key Features
------------
- **Efficient Code Transmission**: Mitogen efficiently transmits and executes code across contexts.
- **Transparent Remote Execution**: Call functions and methods as if they were local.
- **Flexible Context Management**: Support for local, SSH, Docker, and other context types.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you encounter issues with PTY creation, you may need to adjust system settings. On Linux, consider increasing `kernel.pty.max`, and on macOS, adjust `kern.tty.ptmx_max`.
