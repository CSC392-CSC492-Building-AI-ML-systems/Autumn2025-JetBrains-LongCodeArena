for an example on using Kernel Ridge Regression.

Notes
-----

Kernel Ridge Regression is a non-parametric form of ridge regression that
uses the kernel trick to learn in the feature space induced by a kernel
function. It is particularly useful for non-linear regression problems.

The solution can be written in closed form, making it computationally
efficient for medium-sized datasets, though predictions require computing
the kernel between test points and all training points.
