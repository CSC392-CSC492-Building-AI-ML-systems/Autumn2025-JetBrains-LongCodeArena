Bluesky Plans
=============

This module provides a collection of plans for the Bluesky run engine, designed for controlling experiments and data acquisition. The plans include basic counting and scanning operations with support for multiple detectors and motors.

.. currentmodule:: bluesky.plans

Functions
---------

.. autofunction:: count

.. autofunction:: list_scan

.. autofunction:: rel_list_scan

Detailed Descriptions
---------------------

count
~~~~~
.. autofunction:: count

The ``count`` plan takes one or more readings from specified detectors. It supports configurable delays between readings and custom per-shot behavior through a hook function. Metadata is automatically generated and can be extended with user-provided information.

list_scan
~~~~~~~~~
.. autofunction:: list_scan

The ``list_scan`` plan performs a scan over one or more motors simultaneously, moving through specified lists of points (inner product). It ensures all position lists are of equal length and generates appropriate metadata including plan pattern information. Custom per-step behavior can be implemented through a hook function.

rel_list_scan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. autofunction:: rel_list_scan

The ``rel_list_scan`` plan performs a relative scan over one or more motors using positions relative to their current locations. This function is currently under development (TODO).

Notes
-----

All plans support metadata customization and can be extended with custom behavior through hook functions. The plans utilize various decorators for staging detectors and running with metadata.
