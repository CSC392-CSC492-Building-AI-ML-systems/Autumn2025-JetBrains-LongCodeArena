Description
-----------

Calculate state-to-state rates and transition event durations by tracing trajectories.

A bin assignment file (usually "assign.h5") including trajectory labeling is required (see "w_assign --help" for information on generating this file).

The output generated by this program is used as input for the ``w_kinavg`` tool, which converts the flux data in the output file into average rates with confidence intervals. See ``w_kinavg trace --help`` for more information.

.. note::
   This tool is being deprecated. Please use ``w_direct`` instead.

Output Format
-------------

The output file (-o/--output, by default "kintrace.h5") contains the following datasets:

``/conditional_fluxes`` [iteration][state][state]
  *(Floating-point)* Macrostate-to-macrostate fluxes. These are **not** normalized by the population of the initial macrostate.

``/conditional_arrivals`` [iteration][stateA][stateB]
  *(Integer)* Number of trajectories arriving at state *stateB* in a given iteration, given that they departed from *stateA*.

``/total_fluxes`` [iteration][state]
  *(Floating-point)* Total flux into a given macrostate.

``/arrivals`` [iteration][state]
  *(Integer)* Number of trajectories arriving at a given state in a given iteration, regardless of where they originated.

``/duration_count`` [iteration]
  *(Integer)* The number of event durations recorded in each iteration.

``/durations`` [iteration][event duration]
  *(Structured -- see below)* Event durations for transition events ending during a given iteration. These are stored as follows:

  istate
    *(Integer)* Initial state of transition event.
  fstate
    *(Integer)* Final state of transition event.
  duration
    *(Floating-point)* Duration of transition, in units of tau.
  weight
    *(Floating-point)* Weight of trajectory at end of transition, **not** normalized by initial state population.

Because state-to-state fluxes stored in this file are not normalized by initial macrostate population, they cannot be used as rates without further processing. The ``w_kinavg`` command is used to perform this normalization while taking statistical fluctuation and correlation into account. See ``w_kinavg trace --help`` for more information. Target fluxes (total flux into a given state) require no such normalization.
