Manifold Learning
=================

Manifold learning is an approach to non-linear dimensionality reduction that seeks to find
a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data while preserving the underlying
geometric structure. These techniques are particularly useful for visualizing complex
datasets and uncovering intrinsic patterns that linear methods like PCA might miss.

Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS)
-------------------------------

Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) is a technique that projects data into a lower-dimensional
space while attempting to preserve pairwise distances between data points. The scikit-learn
implementation provides both metric and non-metric variants of MDS.

.. autofunction:: _smacof_single

The SMACOF (Scaling by Majorizing a Complicated Function) algorithm is used to solve the
MDS optimization problem. It works by iteratively refining the embedding to minimize the
stress function, which measures the discrepancy between pairwise distances in the original
space and the embedded space.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~
- ``dissimilarities``: Pairwise dissimilarities between points (must be symmetric)
- ``metric``: Whether to compute metric (True) or non-metric (False) MDS
- ``n_components``: Number of dimensions for the embedding
- ``init``: Initial configuration for the embedding
- ``max_iter``: Maximum number of iterations
- ``verbose``: Level of verbosity during computation
- ``eps``: Relative tolerance for convergence
- ``random_state``: Controls random number generation for reproducibility
- ``normalized_stress``: Whether to use normalized stress (Stress-1) instead of raw stress

Returns
~~~~~~~
- ``X``: Coordinates of points in the lower-dimensional space
- ``stress``: Final stress value (measure of fit quality)
- ``n_iter``: Number of iterations performed

The stress value provides a measure of how well the low-dimensional representation
preserves the original distances:
- 0: Perfect fit
- 0.025: Excellent
- 0.05: Good
- 0.1: Fair
- 0.2: Poor
