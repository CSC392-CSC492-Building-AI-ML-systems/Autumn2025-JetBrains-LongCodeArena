Less Frequently Used FITS Data Structures
=========================================

This document describes FITS data structures that are less commonly encountered
in typical usage but may be important for specialized applications or when
working with legacy FITS files.

Verification System
-------------------

The FITS module includes a comprehensive verification system for validating
and correcting FITS data structures:

VerifyError
~~~~~~~~~~~
Exception class for verification errors that cannot be automatically fixed.

VerifyWarning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Warning class for verification issues that can be automatically corrected
or require user attention.

Verification Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The system supports multiple verification modes through the ``option`` parameter:

- ``ignore``: Skip verification entirely
- ``warn``: Issue warnings for problems
- ``exception``: Raise exceptions for problems
- ``fix``: Attempt to fix problems and report changes
- ``silentfix``: Fix problems silently without reporting
- Combined options: ``fix+ignore``, ``fix+warn``, ``fix+exception``,
  ``silentfix+ignore``, ``silentfix+warn``, ``silentfix+exception``

_Verify Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Base class providing shared verification functionality:

- ``run_option()``: Executes verification with specified option handling
- ``verify()``: Main verification method that processes all values

_ErrList Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specialized list class for managing hierarchical verification error messages:

- Maintains nested error structure across different class levels
- Provides formatted output with proper indentation
- Supports filtering of fixable vs. unfixable errors

Notifier System
---------------

NotifierMixin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mixin class that enables objects to register listeners for change notifications:

- Uses weak references to avoid memory leaks
- Supports generic update notifications with ``_notify()`` method
- Listeners implement update methods following ``_update_<change_type>`` pattern
- Automatically handles missing update methods in listeners

Data Handling Utilities
-----------------------

The module includes several utility classes and functions for specialized
data handling scenarios:

- Support for various integer types through ``all_integer_types``
- Path-like object handling with ``path_like``
- Comparison function ``cmp`` for backward compatibility
- Various context managers and decorators for resource management

These structures provide the underlying infrastructure for robust FITS file
handling, particularly for edge cases and error conditions that may not be
encountered in typical usage but are essential for maintaining data integrity.
