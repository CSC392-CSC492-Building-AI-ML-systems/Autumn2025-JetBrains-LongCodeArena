Text Feature Extraction
=======================

The :mod:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text` module provides utilities for converting text documents into numerical feature vectors, which can be used for machine learning tasks.

Overview
--------

This module includes several classes and functions for text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction. The main components include:

- **Vectorizers**: Convert collections of text documents to matrices of token counts or TF-IDF features
- **Preprocessing functions**: Handle text normalization, accent removal, and HTML tag stripping
- **Utility functions**: Support text analysis pipelines with customizable preprocessing steps

Main Components

Preprocessing Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autosummary::

   strip_accents_unicode
   strip_accents_ascii
   strip_tags

Constants

.. autodata:: ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS

Key Features
------------

- Support for custom tokenization and preprocessing
- N-gram generation with configurable range
- Stop word removal with built-in and custom stop word lists
- Unicode handling and text normalization
- Efficient sparse matrix representation for large text corpora
- Support for different input types (strings, files, filenames)

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
   
   corpus = [
       'This is the first document.',
       'This document is the second document.',
       'And this is the third one.',
       'Is this the first document?',
   ]
   
   vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
   X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus)
   print(vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
   print(X.toarray())

Note
----

For serious HTML/XML preprocessing, it's recommended to use external libraries such as lxml or BeautifulSoup rather than the basic ``strip_tags`` function provided in this module.
