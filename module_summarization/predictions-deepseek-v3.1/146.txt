Quick Start
===========

This guide provides a quick introduction to using the toppra library for geometric path processing and analysis.

Geometric Path Interface
------------------------

The core of toppra operates on geometric paths that implement the :class:`AbstractGeometricPath` interface:

.. code-block:: python

    from toppra.interpolator import AbstractGeometricPath
    
    class MyCustomPath(AbstractGeometricPath):
        def __call__(self, path_positions, order=0):
            # Implement path evaluation
            pass
            
        @property
        def dof(self):
            # Return degrees-of-freedom
            pass
            
        @property
        def path_interval(self):
            # Return [start, end] path positions
            pass

Gridpoint Generation
--------------------

Toppra requires well-distributed gridpoints along the path for optimal performance. Use :func:`propose_gridpoints` to generate appropriate gridpoints:

.. code-block:: python

    from toppra.interpolator import propose_gridpoints
    
    # Create your geometric path
    path = MyCustomPath()
    
    # Generate gridpoints with error threshold 1e-4
    gridpoints = propose_gridpoints(
        path, 
        max_err_threshold=1e-4,
        max_iteration=100,
        max_seg_length=0.05
    )

The algorithm iteratively refines gridpoints by estimating interpolation error:

.. math::
    
    err_{est} = 0.5 * \max(\mathrm{abs}(p'' * d_{segment} ^ 2))

where :math:`p''` is the second derivative and :math:`d_{segment}` is segment length.

OpenRAVE Integration
--------------------

Toppra provides integration with OpenRAVE trajectories through :class:`RaveTrajectoryWrapper`:

.. code-block:: python

    from toppra.interpolator import RaveTrajectoryWrapper
    
    # Wrap an OpenRAVE trajectory
    wrapped_traj = RaveTrajectoryWrapper(trajectory, robot)
    
    # Use like any other geometric path
    positions = wrapped_traj(0.5)  # Evaluate at midpoint
    dof = wrapped_traj.dof         # Get degrees-of-freedom

The wrapper supports trajectories with quadratic or cubic interpolation and converts them to piecewise polynomial representation.

Basic Usage Example
-------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # Create or obtain a geometric path
    path = MyCustomPath()
    
    # Generate appropriate gridpoints
    gridpoints = propose_gridpoints(path)
    
    # Use with toppra algorithms
    # (Additional toppra setup code would follow here)
