Tensor Attributes
=================

This document describes the tensor attributes used in the OneFlow MLIR dialect.

Overview
--------
Tensor attributes define various properties and characteristics of tensor types within the OneFlow MLIR infrastructure. These attributes are used to specify metadata, shape information, data types, and other tensor-specific properties that are essential for compilation and optimization.

Core Attributes
---------------

Shape Attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the static shape of a tensor as a list of integers. Used to define the dimensionality and size of each dimension.

.. code-block:: mlir

  !oneflow.tensor<[2, 3, 224, 224]>

DataType Attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Defines the elemental data type of the tensor. Common types include:
- f32: 32-bit floating point
- f64: 64-bit floating point  
- i32: 32-bit integer
- i64: 64-bit integer
- i8: 8-bit integer
- ui8: 8-bit unsigned integer

.. code-block:: mlir

  !oneflow.tensor<f32>

Layout Attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the memory layout and data arrangement of the tensor. This can include:
- Contiguous layout
- Strided layout
- Custom memory formats

Memory Space Attribute
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Indicates the memory space where the tensor is allocated, such as:
- Device memory (GPU)
- Host memory (CPU)
- Pinned memory

Usage Examples
--------------

Basic tensor with shape and data type:

.. code-block:: mlir

  %tensor = oneflow.tensor<[1, 256, 256, 3], f32>

Tensor with explicit layout:

.. code-block:: mlir

  %tensor = oneflow.tensor<[4, 4], f32, layout = "NHWC">

Tensor with memory space specification:

.. code-block:: mlir

  %tensor = oneflow.tensor<[10, 20], f32, memory_space = "cuda">

Attribute Inheritance
---------------------
Tensor attributes can be inherited from operations and automatically propagated through the compilation pipeline, ensuring consistency and enabling various optimizations.
