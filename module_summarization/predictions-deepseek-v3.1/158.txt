Migrating to Nextcord
=====================

This document outlines the key changes and considerations when migrating your code from discord.py to Nextcord.

Widget Changes
--------------

The widget functionality in Nextcord has been updated with improved type safety and consistency.

### WidgetChannel

The ``WidgetChannel`` class remains largely the same but includes proper type annotations:

- All attributes (``id``, ``name``, ``position``) are now properly typed
- The ``mention`` property returns the standard channel mention format
- ``created_at`` property returns the channel's creation time using Discord's snowflake timestamp

### WidgetMember

The ``WidgetMember`` class now inherits from ``BaseUser`` and includes several enhancements:

- Added proper status handling using the ``Status`` enum
- Improved activity creation through the ``create_activity`` utility function
- Added voice state properties: ``deafened``, ``muted``, and ``suppress``
- Includes ``connected_channel`` reference to the member's current voice channel
- Added ``display_name`` property that returns either nickname or username

### Widget Class

The main ``Widget`` class provides access to:

- Guild information (``id`` and ``name``)
- List of accessible voice channels (``channels``)
- List of online members (``members``) - note that offline members are not included due to Discord limitations

Type Hint Improvements
---------------------

Nextcord makes extensive use of modern Python type hints:

- Union types for flexible parameter acceptance
- Optional types for values that can be None
- Generic collections with proper type parameters
- TYPE_CHECKING imports for circular dependency resolution

The widget system demonstrates Nextcord's commitment to type safety while maintaining backward compatibility with existing discord.py code patterns.
