Naive Bayes
===========

The :mod:`sklearn.naive_bayes` module implements Naive Bayes algorithms. These
are supervised learning methods based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong
(naive) feature independence assumptions.

Base Class
----------

.. autoclass:: _BaseNB
   :members: predict_joint_log_proba, predict, predict_log_proba, predict_proba
   :inherited-members:
   :exclude-members: _joint_log_likelihood, _check_X

   Abstract base class for naive Bayes estimators that provides common
   prediction methods for all Naive Bayes classifiers.

Gaussian Naive Bayes
--------------------

.. autoclass:: GaussianNB
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
   :exclude-members: _joint_log_likelihood, _check_X

   Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) assumes that features follow a normal
   distribution. Can perform online updates to model parameters via
   :meth:`partial_fit`.

   Parameters
   ----------
   priors : array-like of shape (n_classes,), default=None
       Prior probabilities of the classes. If specified, the priors are not
       adjusted according to the data.

   var_smoothing : float, default=1e-9
       Portion of the largest variance of all features that is added to
       variances for calculation stability.

   Attributes
   ----------
   class_count_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
       Number of training samples observed in each class.

   class_prior_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
       Probability of each class.

   classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes,)
       Class labels known to the classifier.

   epsilon_ : float
       Absolute additive value to variances.

   n_features_in_ : int
       Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

   feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
       Names of features seen during :term:`fit`.

   var_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_features)
       Variance of each feature per class.

   theta_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, n_features)
       Mean of each feature per class.

Available Classes
----------------

The module provides the following Naive Bayes implementations:

- :class:`BernoulliNB` - For data that follows a multivariate Bernoulli distribution
- :class:`GaussianNB` - For continuous data assuming Gaussian distribution
- :class:`MultinomialNB` - For multinomially distributed data
- :class:`ComplementNB` - Adaptation of MultinomialNB for imbalanced datasets
- :class:`CategoricalNB` - For categorical features

Notes
-----

All Naive Bayes classifiers support:

- Joint log probability estimation via :meth:`predict_joint_log_proba`
- Standard classification via :meth:`predict`
- Probability estimates via :meth:`predict_proba`
- Log probability estimates via :meth:`predict_log_proba`

The algorithms are based on applying Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption
of conditional independence between every pair of features given the class label.
