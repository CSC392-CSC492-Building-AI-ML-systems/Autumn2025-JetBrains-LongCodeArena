# Bug Localization

This folder contains code for **Bug Localization** benchmark. Challenge: 
given an issue with bug description and the repository code in the state where issue is reproducible, identify the files within the project that need to be modified to address the reported bug.

We provide scripts for [data collection and processing](./src/data), [data exploratory analysis](./src/notebooks) as well as several [baselines implementations](./src/baselines) for the task solution with [evaluation metrics calculation](./src/notebooks).
## üíæ Install dependencies
We provide dependencies for pip dependency manager, so please run the following command to install all required packages:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ü§ó Dataset

All data is stored in [HuggingFace ü§ó](JetBrains-Research/lca-bug-localization). It contains:

* Dataset with bug localization data (with issue description, sha of repo with initial state and to the state after issue fixation).
You can access data using [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index) library:
    ```python3
    from datasets import load_dataset
    
    # Select a configuration from ["py", "java", "kt", "mixed"]
    configuration = "py"
    # Select a split from ["dev", "train", "test"]
    split = "dev"
    # Load data
    dataset = load_dataset("JetBrains-Research/lca-bug-localization", configuration, split=split)
    ```
    where labels are:\
    `dev` - all collected data\
    `test` - manually selected data ([labeling artifacts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cEyFHjse-iUYQlUO7GO5KpqkvJ3wu6vheou4W61TMOg/edit?usp=sharing))\
    `train` - all collected data which is not in test\
    and configurations are:\
    `py` -- only `.py` files in diff\
    `java` -- only `.java` files in diff\
    `kt` -- only `.kt` files in diff\
    `mixed` -- at least on of the `.py`, `.java` or `.kt` file and maybe file(s) with another extensions in diff


* Archived repos (from which we can extract repo content on different stages and get diffs which contains bugs fixations).\
